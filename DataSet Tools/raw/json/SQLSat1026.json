XMLA is a powerful tool available in the online Power BI service that allows report developers to connect to their data model and adjust a variety of entities outside the Power BI Desktop application. For example, the XMLA endpoints can be used within a pipeline triggered by an application to update a Power BI model schema. This allows end users to create custom UDFs (user defined fields) on the fly and delete them. Similarly, developers can create and use translations for customer specific column renames without worrying about breaking visuals and complicated data models.",

This will include many of the most common managed ETL/ELT offerings, such as Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue, and GCP Dataflow. Additionally, we will evaluate some open source or multi-cloud alternatives, like Airflow. \r\n\r\nThe session will explore the ease of getting started with each option, go through which languages and infrastructure may be required or supported, and build a short demo of a simple pipeline in each. We will also discuss what the cost differences are to get started and to put into production. ",
