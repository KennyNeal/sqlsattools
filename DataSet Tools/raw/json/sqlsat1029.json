Wasm enables developers to use existing code libraries (e.g. C/C++) as part of their application development process. Wasm is not just for the web and today moves in exciting new directions. One primary use-case would be to run a Machine Learning algorithm directly in a database system on the data already stored in the database system -- an example of co-locating analytics with data. Attendees will learn how we can use an ML classifier and then port the code to a Wasm module. No prior knowledge or experience of Wasm is required. Wasm standards are being developed by the W3C and actively promoted through non-profit organisations such as the Bytecode Alliance.",

The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.",
