      "description": "Have you experienced performance problems caused by contention in TempDB? Have you ever wondered why your TempDB is suddenly 3 TB? In this session, you will learn about all the various components of SQL Server that use TempDB. Whether it be AlwaysOn Availability Groups, Read Committed Snapshot version stores, spills, or simply temporary tables, learn about how to identify what SQL Server or your applications are doing in TempDB. Once you understand all the ways SQL Server uses this critical resource, and how to proper configure it, you'll be better prepared for your workloads whether it be an Azure VM, a physical server, or a container.\r\n",

Watch Microsoft Data Platform MVP, SSIS author, and trainer Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data, and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2019 Integration Services (SSIS 2019) packages.\r\nWe'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. \r\nFinally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.",

Thankfully, SQL Server has several different options to help ensure that your data stays safe from prying eyes.  \r\n\r\nIn this session we will discuss which native encryption solutions can implemented to keep your data secured as best as possible.  We will also take a peak under the covers of how the encryption process works.  Lastly, we'll see some real-world demos of encryption in action.  \r\n\r\nYou will -\r\n\t• Learn about different encryption methods for SQL Server\r\n\t• Determine which solution might be a better fit for your needs\r\n\t• Observe how to implement several encryption solutions\r\n\r\nYou are -\r\n\t• Wanting to secure your data landscape\r\n\t• Not sure of which option would work best\r\n\t• Looking to learn more about data encryption\r\n\r\nIt's not longer a question of if a data breach will occur, but rather a question of when.

However most of the knowledge and experience with DevOps is based around application software and ignores the database. We will examine how the concepts and principles of DevOps can be applied to database development by looking at both automated comparison analysis as well as migration script management. Automated building, testing, and deployment of database changes will be shown.",

That’s where the art of architecting the operationalization aspect come into play.\r\n\r\nIn this demo centric session, we will understand the fundamental building blocks of migrating on-prem SQL server workload to cloud via lift and shift or to Azure SQL/Managed Instance. We will build our hierarchy of needs checklist, a secured data migration plan and perform a sample migration to IaaS and PaaS Azure SQL databases keeping Data Security, Size, Performance, and Cost aspects in mind. By the end of this session, you will have good idea on how to execute a secured and scalable cloud data migration solution.\r\n",
