      "title": "The Evolution of the Data Professional",
      "description": "The data professional is always evolving due to the rapid pace of changing technology, but the pandemic of the last few years has brought about some of the most dramatic changes to our roles we have ever seen. Both in how heavily companies are relying on data to run a successful business and for the employees that are responsible for developing and supporting that. In the current market, data needs and technology have surpassed the resource pool which has resulted in several benefits to the professional including more opportunities, rising compensation, better benefits, flexible working arrangements, and much more. In this presentation, we will dive into the specifics of what the data is telling us about these changes to help you understand your worth and use it to predict what is next so you can make informed decisions about the next stages of your career.",

      "title": "Azure SQL Database Elasticity - Queries, Jobs, Transactions",
      "description": "Microsoft has introduced elastic queries, elastic database jobs, and elastic transactions to the capabilities in Azure SQL Database. All of these elastic capabilities involve working with multiple databases in some way. Elastic queries support sharding and cross database queries. Elastic database jobs support running jobs on Azure SQL Database without SQL Server Agent (which is only available in Azure SQL Managed Instance). And finally, one big application hole in the Azure SQL Database story has been support for distributed transactions. Elastic transactions take the capabilities of MSDTC and embeds them in the engine. These features increase the flexibility of Azure SQL Database and makes it an even better target to for solution that could only be support on premises. The features will be discussed and demonstrated with all code and information available for you after the session.",

      "description": "You expect modern applications to implement at least a basic level of artificial intelligence or machine learning. But machine learning is hard, really hard and not everyone has the time to learn how to use it.  That's where Microsoft Azure comes in. Azure offers a set of products that cover all ranges from novice to machine learning experts.  Cognitive services don't assume any knowledge of machine learning. Azure Machine Learning can handle any machine learning workflow from end to end. The Bot Service makes models available to the world as intelligent agents. And Azure Databricks is a unified platform for analytics and machine learning. In this session, a survey of these products, you will learn how there is something in Microsoft Azure that can meet your machine learning goals. Ph.D. is optional.",
