      "description": "The community-developed and open source dbatools toolkit was initially released in 2019. These tools provide a robust way to manage and interact with SQL Server using PowerShell, allowing us to easily automate routine tasks. Some of the tools are very powerful; for instance, there is a command to migrate an entire instance. With 500 available commands, we won't be able to even come close to covering everything, but we'll cover the basics of how to use dbatools and explore how it can help you with managing and accessing SQL Server.",

When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.",
