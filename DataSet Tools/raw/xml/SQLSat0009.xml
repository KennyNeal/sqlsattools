      <title>Resource Governor in SQL Server 2008</title>
      <description>One of the new features in SQL Server 2008 is the resource governor.  With increasingly consolidated SQL Server environments, and particularly with applications with complex performance requirements, this new feature will provide more fine grained control over how your solutions work.  During this session we will review the functionality included in this feature, identify scenarios where it can be used, and show how to implement it.

      <title>Scaling SQL Server for Large Datamarts</title>
      <description>One of the roles of Business Intelligence for Retailers is to determine buying patterns based on customer demographics.  This type of analysis though can quickly create very large cubes above 600 Gigabytes and often between 1 to 4 Terabytes.   Based on real world experience with two major retailers, this talk will discuss key design tips and best practices for building these large cubes so the data can be accessed in a timely manner.  Key topics covered include vertical and horizontal partitioning, necessary key parameters, and custom aggregations.  </description>

      <title>Using Data Profiling to Improve ETL</title>
      <description>Data quality is one of the most challenging aspects of constructing a reliable data warehouse / business intelligence solution. SQL Server Integration Services 2008 introduces the Data Profiling Task, which can be used to help improve the data quality in the ETL process itself. This session will cover the use of the Data Profiling Task to gather initial quality metrics from both source systems and the warehouse. It will also cover how to incorporate data profiling into the ongoing ETL process to continue gathering quality metrics on new data, and to build dynamic data quality rules that adjust themselves based on the current quality measures.</description>

      <description>One of the common issues encountered with SSIS is deploying configurations for multiple environments. During this session, 3 patterns for handling configurations in SSIS will be covered. from a simple pattern that handles most cases, to a very flexible pattern that covers most complex scenarios. Learning and using these patterns will allow SSIS developers to more easily deploy packages between environments, and leverage a single point of configuration in each environment.</description>
