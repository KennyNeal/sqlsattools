      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>Before you get immersed in all the technical details of SQL Server, let's talk about the fundamentals.  What does it mean to normalize a database?  How do I pick a natural primary key vs. a sequence?  What about naming tables, views, columns, etc?  We will use the "chalk talk" format.  I will introduce a topic then ask the class to share their ideas and experiences with the topic.  We will have plenty of fundamentals to cover, so I will serve as moderator to keep us on track. Quoting cycling great Greg LeMond - "Perhaps the single most important element in mastering the techniques and tactics of racing is experience. But once you have the fundamentals, acquiring the experience is a matter of time."</description>

      <description>This session will cover the tasks you need to perform before you hand over a new SQL Server to production in order to keep the server running smoothly. After this session, you should be able to create a script that best suits your organization in order to make moving a server into production a quick and easy process.  While the session is geared towards new systems, many of these preproduction considerations apply to existing SQL Servers as well.</description>

      <title>Streaming Applications using SQL Server 2008 Files</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 introduced the concept of the FILESTREAM support. Most DBAs whom have been around for a while have in one instance or another supported streaming applications by use of the VARBINARY(MAX) datatype in order to store file information within the database architecture. However, this has drastic limitations as the RDBMS are not typically set up to deal with data that is not accessible in terms of pages and extents. FILESTREAM support adds a new paradigm to the database platform by marrying the database system with the NTFS filesystem in order to overcome these old obstacles. In this session, we will delve into FILESTREAM support, what it takes to implement, and some of the extremely cool things that you can do with this new power</description>

      <title>Using Wait-Time Analysis for Database Performance</title>
      <description>"Using Wait-Time Analysis for Database Performance Monitoring and
Tuning"

There are many ways to use wait events for performance tuning, but often
there is confusion on exactly what the data means. The wait event data
may be analyzed at the wrong level or not detailed enough. Confio will
focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies using
wait event data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to
solve the most difficult performance related issues.

      <title>Near Real-Time Data Warehouse-No Third Party Tools</title>
      <description>The near real-time data warehouse was created to satisfy the needs of our billing department. The data is replicated into the extraction area of the warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server Transactional Replication. When inserts and/or updates occur a message is sent to the message queue via a trigger. There are two C# .net console apps that run, which can also run as a service, that constantly checks the message queue. When
the app finds a message it processes it. The transformation and loading of the warehouse occurs here. Inside of the actual warehouse databases there is a schema named Meta. The schema houses information that is used by the warehouse processor. These tables contain information such as stored procedures and SSIS packages to</description>

      <description>While many DBAs may understand SQL Server 2005/2008 Profiler basics, not too many know how to tap the full potential of this important utility. In this session, DBAs will learn many advanced techniques you can use to troubleshoot both SQL Server problems and performance issues, including: How to Identify and Analyze Slowly Performing Queries, How to Identify Deadlocking Issues, How to Identify Blocked Processes, How to Identify Excessive SP Compilations, How to Identify Excessive Table/Index Scans, How to Identify Memory Problems, and How to Correlate Profiler and System Monitor Data. Given the limited time available, not every possible use of Profiler can be discussed. But by learning these specific examples, the DBA will begin to have a f</description>

      <description>This session, which is designed for part-time or full-time DBAs with one year or less of DBA experience, explores some of the key best practices that all DBAs should be familiar with. The session is divided into two parts. The first covers "Check and Verify," which covers one-time tasks that should be performed on all SQL Servers, and "On-Going Tasks," which cover periodic tasks all DBAs should be performing. Because of time limitations, the focus is on what you need to do, not how to do it. This of this session as a basic checklist of what all DBA need to do to optimize performance and maximize server availablity.</description>

      <description>This session will present a top 10 (maybe 20) list of queries and tools that DBAs can use daily. The idea is that everything is included on a single 1G or less thumb drive to be portable. From simple T-SQL statements to full blown SSIS packages, the session demonstrates how to interogate, diagnose, report on, and resolve issues that are most prevalent for DBAs: disk space, security, backup locations, database and server documentation, performance and much more. All queries, which are SQL 2000, 2005 and yes even 2008 tried and true will be made available in the session to copy to your own thumb drive. If you are lucky you might even receive a free coveted thumb to store the queries.</description>
