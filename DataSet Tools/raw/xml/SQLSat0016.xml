      <title>Working With XML in SQL Server</title>
      <description>XML in SQL 2000 wasn't very exciting and it was easy to dismiss it altogether by just relying on developers to handle any XML needed within the application. SQL 2005 changes the game and this session will show you how to use the XML data type, do basic operations on XML data, and showcase the changes to FOR XML that make it so much more useful. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML if you do need to use it!
Session Goals:
â€¢	Learn how to use FOR XML PATH and WITH NAMESPACE clauses
â€¢	Understand the basic use of the XML data type and XML schema collections
â€¢	Learn how to use XML DML to manipulate XML data

      <title>Wait-Time Based SQL Server Performance Management</title>
      <description>Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.</description>

      <description>The SQL Server 2008 MERGE command combines the features of the Insert and Update commands into a single powerful statement.  You can now insert new data into one table while also updating or deleting data from an existing table with a single statment.  In this sessionk we will explore this new addition to your TSQL toolbox in SQL Server 2008 to show how to merge two tables without creating duplicate records, how to synchronize two tables, how to use the OUTPUT clause with MERGE to save deleted records from the merge into an archival table, and how indexing effects the performance of MERGE statements and more.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Removing Duplicate Records </title>
      <description>Perhaps you inherited a database with one or more tables having duplicate potential keys or maybe even entire duplicate records or maybe you generated a recordset from a SELECT statement that has duplicate records. In any case, you have a problem. You need to identify which tables have duplicate records or duplicate index values, isolate those records, and then delete only the duplicate records from the table. This session will focus on the functions and methods that you can use to identify and remove duplicate data from your tables.</description>

      <description>REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and
cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a
database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource
collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted
with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This
session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its
uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that
developers would then access rather than accessing the database
directly.</description>
