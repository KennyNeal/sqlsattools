      </label>
      <description>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

      <description>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

      <title>Taking Control of SQL Server Error Logs</title>
      <description>The SQL Server Error Logs contain vital information for the day to day DBA. For 1 to 10 servers, reviewing the error logs can be an enlightening experience done manually. For 200+ servers it is more than a chore and automating the consolidation and analysis of the error log contents is essential to be a successful DBA. From failed login attemtps to data corruption, this session will show you how to maintain error log history, raise errors in code that will write to the error log and most importantly, centralize and report on specific errors across multiple servers. The solution will use several different technologies including SSIS and the MERGE statement, new to SQL Server 2008.</description>

      <title>RESTful Data</title>
      <description>REST is an architectural style that allows for a layered, scalable, and cacheable enterprise information system. With ADO.NET Data Services, a database can be surfaced to a service as a REST-style resource collection that is addressable with natural URIs and can be interacted with using the usual HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This session will describe RESTful Data, the benefits it conveys, and its uses. Then we will set up a data service using an existing database that developers would then access rather than accessing the database directly.</description>

      <title>Sql and the Cloud</title>
      <description>This talk will look at the implications of cloud computing for Sql databases. Topics covered will include: What’s in the cloud, data processing or both? Running Sql in the cloud. Sql alternatives in the cloud, SimpleDB, DIY indexing. Stuff that definitely won’t work in the cloud (not at the moment anyway). The talk will be focused mostly on the use of Amazon’s S3, SimpleDB and EC2 with a bit of Rackspace Mosso thrown in. It will demo setting up S3 buckets and EC2 instances. What’s involved in getting Sql Server running on them (including licensing implications) and discuss some of the speaker’s experience in working with the Amazon environment.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Resource Governor</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 introduces a new feature called the "Resource Governor". It allows you to set limits (both minimum and maximum) on your SQL Server Instance's use of CPU and Memory - helping to prevent runaway queries, shoring up your Service Level Agreements, and aiding in consolidating your SQL Server databases onto fewer Instances or even in Virtualization. Come hear Buck Woody, Microsoft's "Real World DBA", present an introduction to this feature, and show you an overview of its functionality and flow.</description>

In any case, you have a problem. You need to identify which tables have duplicate records or duplicate index values, isolate those records, and then delete only the duplicate records from the table. This session will focus on the functions and methods that you can use to identify and remove duplicate data from your tables</description>

      <description>Ever make a bunch of changes to your database then lose track of what you’ve changed? Frustrated with trying to come up with consistent, “meaningful” test data to test your applications? Wish you could unit test your database? Ever forget to make a backup copy of your stored procedure before you made that one line change (that happens to crash the system)? Tired of feeling like you’re not part of the team? We’ll take a look at how Team System can help ease the pain of database development and change management.</description>
