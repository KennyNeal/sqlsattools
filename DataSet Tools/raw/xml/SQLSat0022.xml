      <title>C# Ninjitsu</title>
      <description>C# is no longer a purely object-oriented language. It is no longer just an imperative, class-based, component oriented discipline. It is also a generic, declarative, functional discipline.
 
I will introduce new principles in the context of the classic object-oriented and SOLID principles and show you how to master the C# language to be more declarative, more fluent, and more functionally cohesive.</description>

      <title>Best Practices Every SQL Server DBA Must Know</title>
      <description>The focus on this session is on describing best practices every SQL Server DBA needs to know. These are foundational best practices that, if not followed, could have a significant negative effect on the performance and availability of their SQL Servers. As such, this session is targeted towards those who have less than one year’s experience. This session focuses on key fundamentals, such as: Installing  Upgrading SQL Server; SQL Server Configuration; User Data and Log File Management; Database Configuration Settings; Configuring Critical Maintenance Jobs; Setting Up Alerts for Critical Errors; Security Basics; Implementing a Backup and Restore Strategy; Creating a Disaster Recovery Plan; Testing; Monitoring; and Documentation.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Internals and Architecture</title>
      <description>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:

-	What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-	What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-	How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-	What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?

      <title>Accelerating SQL with Solid State Technology</title>
      <description>Solid-state technologies are changing the way that MS SQL users run their databases. DBA’s are achieving significant TCO savings through performance enhancements, reliability improvements, and reduced energy and real estate costs using solid-state technologies.  Solid state is changing the way datacenters look and how MS SQL Servers perform.

This session will address:

1)	On overview of solid state technology options for SQL Server
2)	Why solid state makes a difference?
3)	An comparison of the different types of NAND Flash-based products and the advantages and disadvantages of each:
a.	Disk-based SSDs
b.	Onboard/Embedded PCI Express devices
c.	Host-based PCI Express devices
4)	Customer proof: Wine.com case study

      <title>CDC + SSIS = SCD </title>
      <description>Building dimensions using the Slowly changing dimension wizard in SSIS is simple and quick. However its performance and flexibility is questionable. Even further, when trying to perform incremental loads of your Dimensions using the aforementioned approach or a custom approach prior to Change Data Captured (CDC) offered certain challenges. In this session Patrick will show you how to utilize CDC and SSIS to incrementally load Type I and Type II dimensions using features that are all native to SQL Server 2008.

      <description>I put together the DBA Repository a few years back and have written and spoken about it for as many years with updates and enhancements over time. At it's heart, the solution employs SSIS and SSRS and in late 2009 I updated it for performance and resiliency. You can read about the original solution in SQL Server Magazine. The latest update will be published in 2010. This will be a sneak peak at those enhancements. The session will cover some interesting uses of package variables and MERGE in SSIS with new reports as well.

      <title>GOD, good object design</title>
      <description>Come learn how to effectively use UML in your everday implementations. As VS2010 boasts UML support right from within the IDE with an array of UML compliant diagrams, we will stick to the whiteboard and avoid the technology. This is meant to force us to think through a problem together as a team and arrive at a common understanding. If there is time left, Danny will open up the IDE and actually implement whatever design the team arrived at. Come learn UML notation and more importantly, good object design! </description>
