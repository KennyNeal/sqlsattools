      <title>Database Mirroring: Maximizing Availability Throug</title>
      <description>Database Mirroring is often thought of as a “set and forget it” technology. But what happens if there are problems and the one person on your team that knows mirroring inside and out is not there? You can have a prolonged outage or you can be prepared ahead of time and set up automation procedures for all of your database mirroring needs.

This session will cover setting up processes to detect problems with database mirroring and setting up processes to automate the maintenance and disaster recovery tasks for database mirroring. Included in the session will be detecting a single database failure and automatically failing over all mirrored databases in response.

      <title>Introduction to SQL Server Integration Services</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integration Services is Microsoft's powerful tool for doing ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) in the Business Intelligence arena. In this introductory course you can get up to speed on the basic tools of ETL and learn how to leverage SSIS not just for BI but for data conversion as well.

      <title>Exploring SQL 2008’s Transparent Data Encryption</title>
      <description>On the surface, Transparent Data Encryption seems to be a security “silver bullet”. The most important feature (besides securing the data) is that it does not require any changes to your application code.

This session will explain the basics of TDE and show detailed performance test results. You will leave with an understanding of what it takes to implement TDE and what the cost will likely be. This is a very valuable new feature that you should know about.</description>

      <title>Using SQL Trace/Profiler Effectively:</title>
      <description>This session will cover how to use SQL Trace/Profiler effectively. Topics include converting trace templates into T-SQL scripts, running server side traces (and why you should do so), reading trace files via T-SQL. Demo will include creating a SQL job that detects high CPU utilization and starts and stops a custom SQL trace when CPU utilization crosses a predefined threshold.</description>

      <title>The SQL Server Resource Governor</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 introduces a new feature called the "Resource Governor". It allows you to set limits (both minimum and maximum) on your SQL Server Instance's use of CPU and Memory - helping to prevent runaway queries, shoring up your Service Level Agreements, and aiding in consolidating your SQL Server databases onto fewer Instances or even in Virtualization. Come hear Buck Woody, Microsoft's "Real World DBA", present an introduction to this feature, and show you an overiew of it's functionality and flow.</description>

      <title>Failover Clustering with Windows Server 2008</title>
      <description>Forget a good portion of everything you know about clustering - Windows Server 2008 changes the game. Come see how the changes and improvements affect clustered SQL Server deployments. In addition to Windows, both SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 will also be discussed. The focus will be on SQL Server 2008 and how its changes to the setup, upgrade, and patching processes (among other things) impact the configuration and administration of a clustered SQL Server 2008 instance. Live demos will be shown, and one copy of Allan’s new book, Pro SQL Server 2008 Failover Clustering, will be given away.</description>

      <title>Hacking SQL / SQL Injection</title>
      <description>Recently there has been an increase in reported SQL Injection attacks using web applications. We will discuss and demonstrate how hackers will attack a database using a web application. The methods demonstrated are freely available on the internet, and require very little skill. We will also discuss 'hardening' the database in order to protect against most attacks. The discussion will include: How to 'Think like a hacker'; The What/How of SQL Injection; Protecting against SQL injection; How to use SQL Server security to limit risk; Protecting your data; Monitoring database activities with minimal performance impact.

      <title>Asynchronous T-SQL processing</title>
      <description>Many times an application needs to launch into execution a T-SQL script, but it is not interested in waiting until the script is finished. Traditionally such a task would be accomplished using a SQL Agent job. I will present an approach that leverages SQL Service Broker Activation mechanism and go over the advantages and disadvantages of this alternative.</description>
