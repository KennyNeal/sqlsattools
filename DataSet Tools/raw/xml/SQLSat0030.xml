      <title>Growing Pains - A Cautionary Tale</title>
      <description>It happens to everyone.  One day your database is humming along quietly serving up choice nuggets of information quickly and efficiently while growing at a slow, steady rate.  Then next day, your database has quadrupled in size and performance has ground to a halt as the system strains under the load.  Management is screaming for answers and you're coworkers are running in circles screaming for their lives.  In this session, we will examine best practices to apply to databases that grow to become very large databases (VLDB).  From hardware configurations (IO, CPU, RAM) to database and index design and partitioning strategies, we will examine which solutions and strategies help and which ones hinder our database on its road to recovery.</description>

      <title>Normalize Metadata for Data Integration Analysis</title>
      <description>Many of today’s business applications feature dozens of interfaces feeding a central database.  Interface source-to-target mapping is now common practice, but if there are many interfaces how do you make sure the work of separate teams on tight timelines dovetails smoothly and avoids the all too common death march of correction and rework?
This presentation shows how normalized metadata can help coordinate team efforts, recording data requirements, the target data model, interface sources, source to target mappings, and relationships among analysis components, and enable an effective division of labor that promotes team efficiency, improves planning, and provides the best possible product for developers and testers.

      <title>The Business End of Data Modeling</title>
      <description>This presentation is about what to expect before you start database design and what to do if you don't get it.  We, as SQL Server Database professionals, apply technology solutions to meet business needs.  The problem is that sometimes we're expected to meet business needs that aren't well defined, or not defined at all.  Attendees will learn about the requirements side of data modeling and how it prepares a database developer to design and build the right solution.  Then, the presentation will cover typical scenarios where critical business definition elements are missing and what the database professional can do make up for the missing requirements pieces and produce a successful result.</description>

      <title>Database Design</title>
      <description>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

      <title>A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL</title>
      <description>Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general. Not so! Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.</description>

      <title>Tuner Helper - A Proven Process In Tuning For DBAs</title>
      <description>Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.

      <title>Database Design Patterns</title>
      <description>Beyond database design fundamentals (for example, Normalization) lies the area where you have to create "real" solutions. In this session, I will cover a good number of patterns that we commonly find useful to try to apply to the problem of building a database solution. Ideas like generalization, subclassing, single table domain tables, optional data, and more will be discussed, some of them good, some not so good (don't assume which will be which), but all that are common and/or useful for your database implementations.</description>

      <title>Virtualize This!</title>
      <description>With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital.  With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments.  In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments.  Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.</description>

      <title>SQL 2008 Change Data Capture Tips and Tricks</title>
      <description>Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the very best features of SQL Server 2008. It's is easy to set up and it essentially makes the transaction logs for your databases both persistent and queryable. Versioning your data has never been easier. But there are dozens of tools for tuning and reporting on CDC that are either undocumented or "loosely" documented by Microsoft. During this session, Brock will show you 20 tips and tricks for making your CDC implementations much richer and easier to maintain.</description>

      <title>Using SSRS to report on IIS Web Logs</title>
      <description>Join us to find out how you can use tools that have no cost (either free or part of SQL Server) to build web site usage analysis reports. We'll use Microsoft's free tool, LogParser to load the data into SQL Server, then we'll use SQL Server Reporting Services to build reports of that data. Finally, we'll deliver those reports inside SharePoint, using SQL Server Reporting Services running in SharePoint Integrated Mode.</description>
