We will compare cmdlets/operations to similar syntax/patterns in the T-SQL language.  We'll also step through one of the most talked about topics (the foreach-object command).  PowerShell has been bragged about since the beginning because of how much you can accomplish in just one line of code.  When you leave this session YOU will be bragging about what YOU can do in just ONE line of code!</description>

      <title>Top 10 Mistakes on SQL Server</title>
      <description>SQL Server encompasses a wide variety of domains – administrative, development, and design.  But despite years of experience with relational databases, SQL Server practitioners frequently make the same mistakes over and over again.  Wouldn’t you like to learn about those mistakes before they ever happen?  This session will answer questions like:
-	What’s the most common Transact-SQL programming mistake and how do I fix it?
-	How do database designers cause problems for future generations of application developers and database administrators?
-	Why do inexperienced database administrators make their own job more difficult and less efficient?

      <title>Delivering BI Solutions Rapidly using Vulcan</title>
      <description>SQL Server, Integration Services, and Analysis Services are used together to deliver BI solutions but development efforts are carried out separately, without sharing of metadata between the products. This creates duplicate effort and compromises the ability to develop agile, iterative solutions.  Vulcan is an open source project from Microsoft (http://vulcan.codeplex.code) that helps bridge this gap, while also providing many of the benefits of code focused approaches used in application development. It allows you to define the relational data marts, ETL, and OLAP cube portions of your BI solution in a common language, and seamlessly uses that information to generate the appropriate database schemas, SSIS packages, and SSAS cubes.          </description>

      <title>As a DBA, Where do I start?</title>
      <description>Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on the responsibility of one or are starting at a new role as a DBA, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority build. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also have a look at some of the available tools and scripts to help us see where our environments rate with the "itties" of Database Administration.</description>

We will take a quick walk through indexing, best practices, some quick tips and then have a more in depth look at Execution Plans, IO Statistics and Profiler. Plus as a DBA, Mike can give a few pointers in working with your organization's own "Dr. No" along the way. Rough Agenda: • Review of Best Practices • Indexing/Table Structure High Level Overview • Will your queries use the index? • Query Plans don’t have to be scary • IO Statistics, Profiler • Put Them Together (Use the tools before you say, "Done!" • Interaction with the DBA (How to be a partner in performance with the DB</description>

      <title>SSIS, You, and ETL Architecture</title>
      <description>BOS30-200: SSIS, You , and Better ETLDid you already learned SSIS, and now want to get serious about ETL? Did you become an SSIS developer by accident, but wonder what makes a good ETL solution? Is your current SSIS solution falling apart and you need to revamp it? The Complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poor crafted solution would inevitable lead to maintenance nightmares, or worse yet to the failure of the whole project. In this session we will try to bridge SSIS and a ETL architecture based on good practices while looking to some lessons learned from real world implementations.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Internals  Architecture</title>
      <description>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:

-	What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems?
-	What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-	How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-	What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-	...and much more.</description>

      <title>Growing Pains - A Cautionary Tale</title>
      <description>It happens to everyone. One day your database is humming along quietly serving up choice nuggets of information quickly and efficiently while growing at a slow, steady rate. Then next day, your database has quadrupled in size and performance has ground to a halt as the system strains under the load. Management is screaming for answers and you're coworkers are running in circles screaming for their lives. In this session, we will examine best practices to apply to reporting databases that grow to become much larger than expected.  We will examine a real-world scenario and discuss the strategies and techniques implemented in order to get the database back on track.</description>

      <title>SSRS In the Enterprise - Surviving With a Smile!</title>
      <description>If you plan to use SSRS in a large enterprise there are many things you should do be successful - things that do not seem to have much prescriptive guidance for. The purpose of this session is to provide you with guidance around those administrative things you should do to have a successful, maintainable SSRS Site in a large Enterprise. We wll discuss
 
How should folder structure and security be set up?
Are there best practices around data sources? 
Are SSRS 2008 Report Models Models ready for the enterprise? 
How should projects be organized?  
Is Report Builder 2.0 good enough yet? 
What works well and what will cause you pain? 
 
We will spend our time in a very practical discussion to help you get SSRS deployed and working.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Service Broker in the Real World</title>
      <description>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Plan Re-use in SQL 2008</title>
      <description>Lack of plan reuse is one of the biggest performance killers in SQL Server and almost everyone has experienced problems in this area before. We will explore exactly how to determine if this is an issue for you and more importantly, how to address it. See what factors determine if a plan gets reused or not and why. We will cover how to issue calls to the database that guarantee reuse and peak performance.  Understanding this aspect of SQL Server is something every good DBA should be fully aware of and attending this session will get you the insight to get started immediately.</description>

      <title>Storage for the DBA</title>
      <description>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</description>

      <title>Practical Performance Monitoring in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Do you know what counters, statistics, events and other information you should be collecting on a regular basis to properly monitor your SQL Server instances? Do you know where your current bottlenecks really are or how to even look for them. In this session we will cover the basics when it comes to monitoring the database, server and hardware that give us the biggest bang for the buck. See how a little bit of effort upfront can lead to a much better understanding of your database environment and put you in a position to spot potential issues before they become real trouble.</description>

      <title>Tuna Helper for SQL Server DBA's</title>
      <description>Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.</description>

      <title>Collecting and Analyzing File  Wait Statistics</title>
      <description>Since SQL Server 2000 we have had the ability to collect statistics on two key areas in terms of performance directly from within SQL Server.  More specifically these are the File  Wait statistics and the information that can be gleaned from these has increased dramatically with each new release. SQL 2008 currently has over 480 events so far. This session will show you how to efficiently capture and analyze the information provided by a set of DMV’s in SQL Server 2005  SQL Server 2008. This knowledge will dramatically decrease the amount of time spent looking for bottlenecks in your system.</description>

      <title>Virtualize This!</title>
      <description>With the list of features of SQL Server growing constantly the need to sandbox and test drive features in a separate environment that can communicate with but not interfere with your existing environment has become vital.  With virtualization, setting up consistent test, dev, and even sandbox environments can happen minutes instead of hours AND be consistent with previous/ existing environments.  In this session we will focus on Microsoft Virtualization solutions that you can leverage starting with your desktop/laptop and extending to your server environments.  Even if you aren’t going to be doing the virtualization yourself it’s good to know what your options are.</description>

      <title>The (Solid) State Of Drive Technology</title>
      <description>Solid State Drives are being heralded as game changers in the world of SQL IO. What was once was a costly technology only available to those with deep pockets is now becoming affordable for mainstream use. This session look into the how SSDs work, how they perform compared to traditional hard drives, and highlight the things you need to consider when implementing SSDs on your SQL Servers. Be sure not to miss a live demonstration of solid state technology in action!</description>

      <title>Is Virtualization is a good choice for SQL Server?</title>
      <description>We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.</description>

      <title>Tips For The Lazy But Driven DBA</title>
      <description>Having had to support a large number of SQL Server instances as a solo DBA for many years I’ve developed a toolbox of scripts and arsenal of processes that I rely upon to give insight into disk space, file growth, backup status, Agent job outcomes, and login management.  Some of these I’ve shared on various websites and blogs; others see the light of day for the first time in this session.  Attendees leave the session with processes and code they can begin to use immediately.</description>

      <title>Automate SQL Server Administration with PowerShell</title>
      <description>Most administrative functions consist of repetitive sequences of tasks which just take time.  PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment which allows an administrator to automate those repetitive tasks, providing better results to the organization while saving the administrator time, and ensuring that the tasks get done properly every time.  This session will give an introduction to PowerShell and demonstrate a number of scripts which help SQL Server administrators effectively manage their environments.</description>
