      <title>What's Really Happening on Your Server: DMV Power</title>
      <description>This session is for the Type A DBAs who are serious about managing their servers as efficiently as possible. The Dynamic Management Objects--a set of views and functions that first shipped with SQL Server 2005--are a window into the inner workings of your SQL Server instance. Locked within the objects is the information you need to help you solve virtually any performance problem, quickly debug problems as they're occurring, and gain insight into what's actually happening on your server, right now. This session is a fast-paced tour of the ins, outs, whys, hows, and even pitfalls of 15 of the most important views and functions. You will learn how to understand transaction behavior, locking, wait statistics, sessions, requests, and much more.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Working With Execution Plans</title>
      <description>This session will focus on how best to use and access execution plans. The use of execution plans will focus on identifying and fixing common performance and execution problems within TSQL. The methods defined for using execution plans will follow a problem/solution paradigm in order to show practical ways that execution plans can help solve common problems. Access of execution plans is normally only defined as being from the Management Studio GUI. This session will show methods of access that include direct queries into the procedure cache using dynamic management views and functions and plans captured through the use of trace events defined in Profiler. Access through XQuery against the XML will be demonstrated through several practical a</description>

      <description>In this talk, Mike will show us some of the tools that come with SQL Server and how they can be used to analyze the performance of our database code. We will take a quick walk through indexing, best practices, some quick tips and then have a more in depth look at Execution Plans, IO Statistics and Profiler. Plus as a DBA, Mike can give a few pointers in working with your organization's own "Dr. No" along the way. Rough Agenda: • Review of Best Practices • Indexing/Table Structure High Level Overview • Will your queries use the index? • Query Plans don’t have to be scary • IO Statistics, Profiler • Put Them Together (Use the tools before you say, "Done!" • Interaction with the DBA (How to be a partner in performance with the DB</description>

      <description>PowerShell is a relatively new scripting environment from Microsoft and SQLCMD is a replacement of OSQL. Every day we perform many similar database-related tasks. Why not write once and then reuse that code multiple times? I will give an overview of Powershell and SQLCMD. Then we will see how to use them in SQL Server environment to automate repetitive tasks, write a flexible code, perform tasks while away from the computer, and perform many other time-saving activities.</description>

      <description>In this session, I will cover the new PowerPivot (formerly known as Gemini Project) a data analysis add-in that delivers computational power directly within MS Excel 2010. By combining native Excel 2010 functionality with PowerPivot’s in-memory engine will allow users to interactively explore and perform calculations on large data sets. You can easily streamline the process of integrating data from multiple sources – including corporate databases, spreadsheets, reports, and data feeds.  Share and collaborate by easily publishing your analysis to SharePoint 2010 and have other users enjoy the same slicer and fast-query capabilities when working on your Excel Services reports.</description>

      <description>Whether you are new to the role of DBA, being "forced" to take on the responsibility of one or are starting at a new role as a DBA, knowing where to start can often mean the difference between success or failure. In this chat, Mike will help us wade through the noise that attacks a DBA and figure out just what our priorities should be. By focusing on the "itties" of Database Administration (Recoverability, Availability - Health  Performance - , Security and Reliability) we can see a natural priority build. Throughout this interactive discussion we will also have a look at some of the available tools and scripts to help us see where our environments rate with the "itties" of Database Administration.</description>

This has lead to severe losses and considerable client liability. Many firms are now starting to take a ‘serious look’ at the potential utilization of data mining techniques as part of their ongoing efforts to control their risk exposure. This beginner to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at showing the attendee some of the ‘data mining’ prototypes solutions that we are currently developing with SQL Server 2005 / 2008, as a part of our ongoing efforts to manage our risk.</description>

      <description>Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.</description>

      <title>Data Access Layers: A Cornucopia</title>
      <description>How often have our SQL Servers been bogged down with a myriad of users issuing lengthy and poorly constructed or poorly performing queries against our tables and views. More often than not, nearly bringing our systems to their knees. Nowhere is this truer than within the financial world where heavy number crunching is par for the course. This beginners to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at the SQL Server developer and business analyst alike and will show the attendee how we have managed to eliminate 90 % of our poorly performing queries by creating data access layers which provides our end users with a suite of well developed and tuned SQL Server FUNCTIONS with which to render their data. </description>
