      <title>A Dynamic World Demands Dynamic SQL</title>
      <description>Dynamic SQL is a misunderstood and much maligned part of a DBA’s tool kit – it can be used to solve difficult business problems, respond to diverse data needs, and alleviate performance problems. Many DBAs reject dynamic SQL outright as a potential source of SQL injections, being poorly performing, or just for being a hacky solution in general.

Jeremiah Peschka has been making extensive use of dynamic SQL throughout his career to solve a variety of problems. He’ll set about dispelling these misconceptions and demonstrate how dynamic SQL can become a part of every DBA’s tool kit.

      <title>Intro to WCF Data Services and OData</title>
      <description>Exposing your data to client applications is a common requirement across most applications; however, there are many ways to accomplish this.  Each application seems to implement it a different way which leads to inconsistency across your application spectrum.  With the release of the .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft has introduced WCF Data Services (was ADO.NET Data Services) which is a collection of classes and standards to allow you to expose your data consistently and securely to your client applications.  We'll focus on WCF Data Services in .NET 4, in which Microsoft has beefed up the offering, and also the data protocol known as OData.</description>

      <title>Wait-Time Based SQL Server Performance Management</title>
      <description>Using Wait Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Wait-Time based performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.</description>

      <description>It’s no secret that social networking is here to stay.  Rather than shutting down all social networking at work organizations should put policies, procedures and training in place for responsible tweeting, blogging, etc.  These policies should include responsible ways to use the media rather than abuse it.  Included in this presentation will be ways to structure your policies.  These methods will help your organization use social networking to promote your brand and educate consumers about new products and services.

      <title>Automate SQL Server Administration with PowerShell</title>
      <description>Most administrative functions consist of repetitive sequences of tasks which just take time.  PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment which allows an administrator to automate those repetitive tasks, providing better results to the organization while saving the administrator time, and ensuring that the tasks get done properly every time.  This session will give an introduction to PowerShell and demonstrate a number of scripts which help SQL Server administrators effectively manage their environments.</description>

      <description>Nobody wants to have a catastrophic event, but bad things happend to good datacenters.  Whether it's 42 inches of snow, 18 inches of rain, extended power outage, whatever, your business needs to be able to operate.  We'll start at a general level in terms of how to build your DR plan and then drill specifically into what you need to do to restore database services to an operational state.  We'll draw on information from the High Availability session and add additional color commentary on what the most important things are to consider when building, and most importantly testing your DR plan. </description>

      <title>Developers….Are We Just a Commodity?</title>
      <description>It’s a contracting market.  Companies are reducing costs across the board.  With outsourcing and off-shoring achieving success, how can today’s in-house developer prove his value to the business?  Technical expertise is valuable to product and technical management. However, it’s the developer’s understanding of the business and his role in generating revenue that’s invaluable.  This presentation explains various techniques developers can use to increase their business savvy, proving they are providing value and not just an expense.
