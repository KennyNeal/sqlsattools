      <title>Data Mining with Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Modern day computing power along with SQL Server makes it possible to add sophisticated data mining models to our applications that forecast and predict, perform anomaly detection, and classify data.  This presentation will demonstrate how to use Analysis Services to incorporate these complex algorithms seamlessly into your databases, from transactional processing to integration, data analysis and performance management.  Attendees will be shown how to create a data mining model using SSAS, how to use SSIS to query and load mining forecasts, and a sample application that seamlessly uses the mining model.   Take a step forward towards making BI pervasive in your organization by integrating data mining into your company’s applications. </description>

      <title>Accelerating SQL with Solid State Technology</title>
      <description>Solid-state technologies are changing the way that MS SQL users run their databases. DBA’s are achieving significant TCO savings through performance enhancements, reliability improvements, and reduced energy and real estate costs using solid-state technologies.  Solid state is changing the way datacenters look and how MS SQL Servers perform.

This session will address:

1)	On overview of solid state technology options for SQL Server
2)	Why solid state makes a difference?
3)	An comparison of the different types of NAND Flash-based products and the advantages and disadvantages of each:
a.	Disk-based SSDs
b.	Onboard/Embedded PCI Express devices
c.	Host-based PCI Express devices
4)	Customer proof: Wine.com case study

      <title>Movin Uptown: Migrating from Access to SQLServer</title>
      <description>Darrell will be describing an import classification application initially developed entirely in Access and then converted to SQL Server 2008, leaving the Access UI intact.  Darrell will demonstrate both the before and after versions, showing how he migrated the Access macros and VBA code to SQL stored procedures, and what he learned along the way. This topic should be of particular interest to: Database designers, Access developers, SQLServer application developers, and anybody considering an Access-to-SQLServer migration. Some of the key points of interest: Data-driven application design, SQLServer vs Access performance advantages, How to use pass-through SQL, Leveraging the power of SQLServer, Access design considerations.</description>

      <title>How the Query Optimizer Works</title>
      <description>The Query Optimizer is the component of SQL Server that attempts to determine the best way to execute a query by finding an efficient execution plan. This session will show you how a better understanding on how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your databases. See how you can provide SQL Server with appropriate statistics and indexes so it can perform better cardinality estimation and produce an efficient execution plan. Learn how you can troubleshoot problems if you are not getting an efficient execution plan and how you can use other alternatives like hints or plan guides to help the query optimizer to produce a better plan.</description>

      <title>Fixing performance problems - Stuff happens</title>
      <description>I will discuss tricky tuning issues that I have encountered during my years speeding up SQL Server. Simple rules often don't apply to complex problems. SQL Server queries can have a wide variety of complexities.
Slow queries are caused by these issues: 1. data might be retrieved from disk or RAM 2. row estimates are too high or too low 3. functions are zero costed 4. the optimizer doesn't know the value of a local variable 5. a query is too complex for the optimizer to do a great job 6. indexes compete for RAM 7. optional parameters 8. a high cost query only using 1 cpu 9. table variables  10. the optimizer isn't perfect

      <title>SQL Design Patterns</title>
      <description>Patterns emerge as both templated solutions to recurring problems and designs, as well as provide useful ways to encapsulate complex ideas into smaller, friendlier terms. Patterns gained popularity in the object-orientated community since the Fowler and the Gang Of Four, but declarative languages, like SQL, have had little-to-no coverage of how these patterns can be applied.

Understanding SQL design patterns is a crucial skill every SQL developer must learn and use in their career. SQL patterns can be applied to small projects or large, multi-million dollar systems, to provide common solutions to complex problems.

Patterns create a foundation for "best practices" for SQL, Database Architecture, managers.</description>

      <title>Is Virtualization is a good choice for SQL Server?</title>
      <description>We’ll be looking into the pros and cons of moving SQL Servers into a virtual server environment.  Specifically we’ll be looking into when it’s a good idea and when it’s probably not a good idea.  Like all problems in the database world there are no hard set answers as to if virtualization is a good idea, but there are some times when virtualizing a SQL Server is a good idea, and can save you some money.  There are some other times when you will be shooting yourself in the foot and shouldn’t.  We’ll be focusing on when how to make this decision, and how to gather the metrics that you need in order to come to this decision.</description>

      <title>Locks, Blocks, Deadlocks and Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>Concurrency management is a fundamental function of RDBMs. In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses locking to manage the conflicting goals of concurrency and ACID compliance. You will learn about the different lockable resource types, lock granularities and modes, and how the selection of transaction isolation levels modulates locking behavior. A novel locking pattern used at MySpace called READ UNTIL will be described. You will also be given a demonstration of troubleshooting techniques using documented and undocumented features, along with a research technique to help further your own locking knowledge.</description>
