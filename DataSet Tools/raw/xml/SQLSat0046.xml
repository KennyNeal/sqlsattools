      <title>Processing Flat Files with SSIS</title>
      <description>When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. You’ll also see how to produce complex output formats.</description>

      <title>Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008</title>
      <description>Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle.  The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning.  It is simple, efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Fixing Performance Problems using </title>
      <description>This session will demonstrate how SQL Server execution plans can be used to identify problems with the database design, or the TSQL code, and address those problems. The session takes the user through various common issues such as poor or missing indexes, badly written code and generally bad query performance, demonstrating how to identify the issues involved using execution plans. The session will then demonstrate methods for addressing the issues and show how the fixed query's execution plans differ. Multiple methods for accessing execution plans including GUI, DMV's, and trace events are demonstrated. This lays a foundation for a general troubleshooting approach to empower the attendee to make their own queries run faster.</description>

      <title>Windows PowerShell Best Practices for SQL DBA's</title>
      <description>Learn Windows PowerShell best practices as they apply to each stage of the script development lifecycle. See the differences between working interactively from the Windows PowerShell prompt, writing an inline script, adding basic function, advanced functions and finally the implementation of Windows PowerShell Modules. What is a local best practice for Windows PowerShell development is not the same as a global best practice, and this talk covers those differences. </description>

      <title>Patterns for SSIS Configuration and Deployment</title>
      <description>Some of the most common issues encountered with SSIS are related to configuring and deploying the packages in different environments. There are a number of options for how to configure your package, and more options for how to deploy them. When you combine the available options, the possibilities can be overwhelming. During this session, we will discuss several patterns for handling configurations and deployment in SSIS. Specifically, we’ll cover two patterns for configurations – a simple pattern that can be applied to most scenarios, and a more complex pattern that provides a great deal of flexibility. We’ll also cover two methods of deploying the packages that leverage the configuration patterns.</description>

      <title>Self-Service BI with PowerPivot</title>
      <description>PowerPivot is one of the most significant, arguably Microsoft’s most important Business Intelligence (BI) advance since the advent of Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services 2005. It seriously delivers on the long-awaited promise of “self-service BI” and “BI for the masses”, by leveraging Microsoft Excel, the world’s most-used analysis platform, Microsoft SharePoint, the rapidly growing collaboration platform, and a new, in-memory version of Analysis Services. PowerPivot enables end users to build high performance analytic applications without having to wait for IT to build cubes and develop the extract transform and load (ETL) process to populate them, or to learn MDX to achieve multidimensional calculations.</description>

      <title>Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.</description>

Have you ever thought that working with strings and dates in T-SQL is needlessly difficult and painful? This session will help demystify CLR integration, show you how to expose basic CLR functionality to your database, demonstrate how to get large performance gains from very little CLR code and give you the information and evidence you need to convince your DBA that the CLR is not inherently evil, and in the right circumstance, is the best solution to a problem</description>

      <description>“Like other occult techniques of divination, the statistical method has a private jargon deliberately contrived to obscure its methods from non-practitioners.”  Ashley-Perry Statistical Axioms
Statistics are the life blood of a cost based optimizers such as SQL Server and are a key component of performance tuning. This session will attempt to demystify statistics in regards to SQL Server the query optimizer.  The internals of statistics will be examined and explained so that you will understand what statistics are available, how the optimizer uses those statistics, what causes statistics to be recomputed and when it happens. </description>

      <description>How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.</description>

      <title>Object Relational Mappers for the DBA</title>
      <description>Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are a tool often praised by developers and despised by DBAs. I'll show that, like most tools, ORMs have their place if used responsibly. They can also get out of hand if they are trusted to always do the right thing. I will demonstrate usage of the most common ORMs for .NET and how each can go awry as well as how to monitor each for proper usage. This will not be a validation or admonishment of their usage; simply a look at their advantages and how to overcome some of their disadvantages.</description>

      <title>The Shade Tree Mechanic's Guide to SSAS</title>
      <description>This is a session for the SQL DBA that has SSAS in their environment, but is not sure what happens under the hood when it queried, much less how to tell if it's performing at its best.  This is not a session on query optimization.  But, this session will help you better understand if there is room for query optimization or if some basic configuration changes might provide that needed boost.  We'll discuss the basic architecture of SSAS and cover some of the most pertinent metrics to give you a quick and easy view into your SSAS server's performance.</description>
