      <title>DBA as Protector of the Data: Notes from the Field</title>
      <description>The DBA can be the last line of defense guarding the integrity of their company’s data. Taking this responsibility seriously will make you more successful in your job. This session will discuss how the DBA can proactively ensure the data in their transactional system is clean and correct. The presenter will take a comprehensive view of this crucial aspect of the DBA’s job, drawing on many real-life examples. The topics covered will include table design, transactions, change management, and coding standards. She will explain how these distinct topics are actually part of an integrated approach to data protection. The presenter will also describe how pessimism and vigilance can be valuable traits for a DBA. </description>

      <description>We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). There are many facets to review. I would like to start by drawing concepts from several articles from experienced practitioners, either from academia or the commercial market. They will be footnoted at the end of the session. Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms</description>

      <title>Where Are My Reports? Managing Reporting Services</title>
      <description>Reporting Services has quickly become and enterprise class report delivery system. As such, user adoption can grow quite rapidly and before you know it higher usage can bring the Report Server to its knees. This is why monitoring and maintaining reporting services from the beginning is important part of any deployment. 

In this session we will cover common scenarios for monitoring reporting services performance, tracking down performance issues and troubleshooting errors. We will also review solutions to improve performance in the report execution and engine configuration. Finally, we will discuss techniques to scale up and scale out to distribute load and isolate various forms of activity.

      <title>Creating a Metadata Mart w/ SSIS - Data Governance</title>
      <description>Recently I have had a client that required migrating and re hosting a data warehouse from the Oracle environment to the Netezza Appliance. The application had hundreds of tables and almost 2900 Source to Target Mappings. This would have taken 1000's of hours of manual coding. For this client we implemented a reusable data driven architecture , via SSIS, that relys on a metadata mart. The end result a greatly reduced TCO(developemnt effort) for generating the code required vs manual cosing. In addition the process leaves behind a metadata mart to report on for auditing and other Data Governance efforts. We generated over 100,000 lines of code and over 3000 load scripts</description>

      <title>Empowering End Users with Report Models</title>
      <description>With the introduction of Report Builder in Reporting Services 2005, end users were given the tools to create self-service Reporting Services reports quickly and easily. 

In this session we will discuss concepts of the Report Model including Entities, Attributes, Roles and other components. We will discuss organization and security within the Report Model to protect data and create a logical view for the business. Then we will cover the methods for creation of an over an existing database and modify them to support specific needs. Once we deploy the Report Model we will build reports and see how the evolution of the Report Builder has enhanced the self-service reporting experience.  </description>

      <title>Tuna Helper - Proven Process for Tuning SQL</title>
      <description>Many DBAs and developers are faced with tuning poorly performing SQL statements. There is no way to learn everything you need to know about SQL tuning in an hour, but you can learn a process to employ when badly written SQLs are ruining database performance. However, many tuning projects fail because the process being used is inefficient. This presentation will walk through a process Confio Software uses with great success and will include topics such as: SQL diagramming, wait type data, column selectivity, and several more that will help you succeed on future tuning projects.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX</title>
      <description>In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets. </description>

      <title>Powershell Eye for the Monitoring Guy</title>
      <description>Server monitoring can be expensive and is generally licensed for only critical production servers. In this session, learn how to utilize Powershell along with SMO to not only be proactive, but productive in monitoring the servers in your environment.  Attendees will come away from the session with an understanding of how to read the server event logs, check backups, and collect performance metrics.  This will be useful for general monitoring in your environment and can also be used for collecting data in a physical to virtual migration.</description>

      <title>Work/Life Balance?  Just A Myth?</title>
      <description>Many of us started our IT careers in the exact same way: 80-hour work weeks, routine overnight gigs, no life outside the office—this was simply what we considered “normal.” Today, with our careers underway, how do we build a life outside of our IT world? I will share the tips, tricks and tools I’ve discovered and used to create a work/life balance that allows us to feel fulfilled and refreshed outside the office while maintaining our effectiveness as successful data professionals. </description>
