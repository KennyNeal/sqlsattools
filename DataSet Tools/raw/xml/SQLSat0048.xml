      <title>Business Intelligence: Decaffeinated Please! </title>
      <description>For many Database Administrators, Data Analysts and other IT and Business Professionals, Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehousing (DW) may be a new and uncharted territory with no clear path towards the destination. Others, who have already jumped head-on into the Business Intelligence journey, may be facing challenges that can potentially put their efforts at risk of failure. In this session I will go over some of the basic concepts that are key in understanding BI and DW. I will also go over the natural roadmap towards BI success, its maturity stages and some of the factors that influence a successful BI project. I will exemplify all these concepts by showcasing a successful real-world BI and DW solution.

      <title>Managing Database Schemas With VS201 DB projects</title>
      <description>Most developers agree that the database is the most important component in a typical application, yet the processes for managing changes to database objects as part of the development cycle are often rudimentary or inexistent.
In this session Rafael explains how you can use Visual Studio database projects to have better control over your database development cycle and  reduce the risk and complexity involved in managing  schema changes, testing and deployment.  He will talk about the pros and cons he has experienced when using VS DB projects in his last projects, and will highlight some of the  improvements available in the latest version of the tool. 
This session showcases VS 2010, but most the content remains relevant for VSDB2008 GDR2</description>

      <description>Learn Windows PowerShell best practices as they apply to each stage of the script development lifecycle. See the differences between working interactively from the Windows PowerShell prompt, writing an inline script, adding basic function, advanced functions and finally the implementation of Windows PowerShell Modules. What is a local best practice for Windows PowerShell development is not the same as a global best practice, and this talk covers those differences.

      <title>Information Visualization - Making great Charts</title>
      <description>This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards and charts should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. I will prove that you are blind! You will be surprised.  Join me - this session is going to be hoot!</description>

      <title>Planning your ETL architecture with SSIS</title>
      <description>The complexity and importance of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) projects are often underestimated, and the consequences of a poorly planned and executed ETL project will inevitably lead to maintenance nightmares, low reliability of the system, or worse yet, to the failure of the project. 
In this session, we will use ETL best practices to make a requirements checklist you can use in your next ETL implementation, and will demonstrate  how you can use SSIS to implement and meet  such requirements. If  you already learned the basics about SSIS and now want to take your ETL solutions to the next level, or if you became an SSIS developer/architect by accident and wonder what do you need to succeed, then this is the right session for you.</description>

      <title>Confessions of a Data Integrator: Bad Designs</title>
      <description>As database systems become more prevalent, the need to integrate disparate data sources becomes more pressing. DBA’s and developers are often forced to support code they can’t control, and must find ways to support poorly designed relational systems. The purpose of this presentation is to explore some of those challenges and discuss possible solutions using certain "taboo" tools including string parsing, looping, and dynamic SQL. Recommended for experienced T-SQL programmers only. </description>

      <title>Creating Custom Components for SSIS</title>
      <description>SSIS data flows are great tools for moving data. But what if you need to go beyond the out-of-the-box components provided with SSIS? Custom components are a great way to encapsulate and reuse functionality for the data flow in SSIS. We will discuss what it takes to create and deploy custom components in SSIS, review the pros and cons of using custom components instead of scripts, and discuss some of the common challenges and issues with creating them.</description>

      <description>A good professional development plan has to go far beyond ‘learning more technology’, it has to encompass the wide variety of skills you need to build the next step in your career, and it has to include a variety of learning methods. We’ll discuss how much time and money you should budget when building your plan, and how the distribution of time and money changes as your career evolves. We’ll look at the growth phases you’ll encounter, learning how you learn best, how to keep up with new technology without burning out, and even how things like blogging and Twitter can be an interesting part of your plan.

      <description>In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets. </description>

      <title>Processing Flat Files with SSIS</title>
      <description>When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. </description>

      <title>SQL Server Service Broker – An Overview</title>
      <description>Service Broker can be used to simplify messaging between applications and assist in asynchronous programming by queuing messages and/or events. This presentation will explain how to use the Service Broker services, discuss its many components and show why you’ll benefit from using it. Finally a case study will illustrate an elegant way to maintain data across multiple servers and show how to reduce dependencies between related programs and/or data structures.

      <title>Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, we will discuss the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Plan Re-use in SQL 2008</title>
      <description>Lack of plan reuse is one of the biggest performance killers in SQL Server and almost everyone has experienced problems in this area before. We will explore exactly how to determine if this is an issue for you and more importantly, how to address it. See what factors determine if a plan gets reused or not and why. We will cover how to issue calls to the database that guarantee reuse and peak performance. Understanding this aspect of SQL Server is something every good DBA should be fully aware of and attending this session will get you the insight to get started immediately.

      <title>Get Cert! Get Cred!</title>
      <description>Obtaining a certification may be a dreaded and stressing process for some people. Most people fail because of their failure to plan a realistic roadmap towards their goals and not necessarily because they lack the skills. 

This session will focus on establishing a roadmap towards certification success for the MCTS and MCITP programs of SQL Server and Business Intelligence. I will do a quick overview of my recent success obtaining 4 certifications in 30 days and how you can achieve similar goals. 

But why certify? Join me to find out the opportunities you may be missing on! </description>

      <description>Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are a tool often praised by developers and despised by DBAs. I'll show that, like most tools, ORMs have their place if used responsibly. They can also get out of hand if they are trusted to always do the right thing. I will demonstrate usage of the most common ORMs for .NET and how each can go awry as well as how to monitor each for proper usage. This will not be a validation or admonishment of their usage; simply a look at their advantages and how to overcome some of their disadvantages.</description>

      <description>OLAP, Cube, BI, SSAS -- what is the difference? In this session look at the difference between a database designed for OLAP and OLTP -- star and snowflake schemas and the benefits and costs of each. After we understand what is sourcing a cube we will look at the basic cube structure, how to source from OLTP or OLAP database and the cost of ROLAP, HOLAP and MOLAP. I have implemented many cubes for small finance departments allowing them to browse a nightly set of data in Excel, without them downloading spreadsheets of data during production hours. The cube improved overall system performance without a redesigned database.

      <title>Bad SQL</title>
      <description>How do you tell good code from bad?  Bad SQL code makes the system work harder for the same results.  Bad SQL does not scale well with larger data sizes, nor does it scale with increased server activity.  Extreme Bad SQL can bring a server to a grinding halt.   This presentation shows you how and why certain commonly used SQL constructions are Bad SQL.  Bad SQL is not very useful by itself so each example includes its Good SQL counterpart.</description>
