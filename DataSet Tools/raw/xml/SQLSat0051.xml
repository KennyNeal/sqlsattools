      <title>Take the Awesomeness Home: the Data Collector</title>
      <description>Conferences provide insight into how to query your SQL Servers' performance, configuration, and needs. But there is a problem for the DBA: how do we quickly apply our new knowledge and scripts to multiple production servers? How do we collect the data we need regularly and query which instances need the most attention? How can we easily create reports proving ROI? In this session, attendees will learn to set up performance data collection with the SQL 2008 Management Data Warehouse (MDW). We will demonstrate how fast it is to create and configure custom data collections, giving examples from simple to complex scripts. This is the tool you need to automate collection for the awesome insights you've learned at the SQL Saturday!</description>

      <title>Design and Implement Like Edison!</title>
      <description>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor.  In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence solutions. </description>

      <description>SSIS data flows are great tools for moving data. But what if you need to go beyond the out-of-the-box components provided with SSIS? Custom components are a great way to encapsulate and reuse functionality for the data flow in SSIS. We will discuss what it takes to create and deploy custom components in SSIS, review the pros and cons of using custom components instead of scripts, and discuss some of the common challenges and issues with creating them.</description>

      <title>Information Visualization - Designing great Charts</title>
      <description>This session will provide you with some surprising and interesting insights into how dashboards should be designed. Called Information Visualization, there is a whole line of thinking which maps how the brain interprets what the eyes see. We will translate this into best (and worst) practices related to visualization in dashboard, scorecard, table, and report design. Both funny and informative, you will probably learn, as I did, that you have been designing your dashboards/scorecards and reports badly. We are going to take a visualization test, and learn how to convey information in a clearer, better way. You will be surprised.  Join me - this session is going to be hoot!</description>

      <title>DMV Emergency Room!</title>
      <description>If you have ever been responsible for a mission critical database, you have probably been faced with a high stress, emergency situation where a database issue is causing unacceptable application performance, resulting in angry users and hovering managers and executives. This session will show you how to use DMV queries to quickly detect and diagnose the problem, starting at the server and instance level, and then progessing down to the database and object level.  This session will show you how to assemble and use an emergency DMV toolkit that you can use to save the day the next time a sick database shows up on your watch in the Database ER!</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2008 R2 Utility and Data-tier Apps</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 R2 introduced two new features that improve your ability to manage Database Engine instances. The SQL Server Utility makes it easier to find, consolidate, and manage many instances. Data-tier applications are new units for designing, deploying, and managing databases. Learn how the utility and DACs work together to make it easier for you to track and manage your instances and databases.</description>

      <title>Fortress SQL Server</title>
      <description>In this session we'll look at how to lock down SQL Server installation starting from the operating system and diving in to SQL Server itself. We'll take on the mindset of someone in the business of breaking into systems for pay and how they would attack SQL Server. This will lead us to consider the appropriate defenses we need to have in place. Finally, we'll look at how to take this information and come up with reasonable costs for breaches as well as the defenses we want to put in place to it in order to present to the business side for additional funding/time to secure our systems properly.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture</title>
      <description>Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment.</description>
