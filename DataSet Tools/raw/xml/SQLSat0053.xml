      <title>Essentials of a Business Intelligence Architecture</title>
      <description>SQL Server allows you to construct an analytic organization by creating a bona fide Business Intelligence foundation, giving you more insight into the status of the business, powerful ad-hoc reporting capabilities, dynamic analytical capabilities, and forecasts that make your psychic jealous. It's an understatement to say this requires really good data and terrific data structures. In this session, Carlos Bossy will discuss how to use SSIS to implement integration, metadata and transformations, SSAS for ad-hoc and predictive analytics, and SSRS to provide users the ability to develop their own reports. You will leave this session with a firm grasp to building a robust data architecture that achieves successful Business Intelligence.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Security - All Things Considered</title>
      <description>Join me for a discussion of security risks in SQL Server and the tools and processes we have to mitigate those risks.   The relationship of security to authentication, encryption, SQL Injection, SQL Browser, backups, auditing, compliance, data access layers, and more will be covered in brief.   Attendees will leave this session knowing the pros and cons of different logon methods,  and hopefully new techniques to reduce the attack surface of the SQL Servers they manage.

      <title>Going Spatial!</title>
      <description>Spatial data is being pushed more and more into the forefront of our application universe. With the advent of MapPoint and Google Maps companies are consistently pushing the boundaries of what traditional databases can do. Now with SQL Server 2008 we have built in spatial data types that will make your life a little easier in the days to come. This session will focus on utilizing these native types to store, analyze, and retrieve spatial data as well as tools such as SSRS's integrating geospatial mapping to make you the company geospatial hero. Geospatial awesomeness fro everyone!</description>

      <title>Incremental ETL Processes with SSIS</title>
      <description>Do you truncate and load your data every time you run your ETL processes? Do you want better performance out of your ETL processes? If you answered yes to either of those questions, this is your session.  We'll be discussing some of the evils and gotchas of the "trunc and load" ETL process, why incremental ETL processes are better overall, and we'll take a look at several different implementations of incremental ETL processes using SSIS both from a data quality and a performance perspective.</description>

      <title>Start Using MDX with SSAS 2008</title>
      <description>MDX is difficult to learn for many reasons. One reasons is that most training starts with SELECT queries without adequately developing a fundamental understanding of the coordinate system being used. Learners are left to fill in the blank in a way that is not comprehensive, consistant or comfortable. This presentation will give beginners (and those beyond) a more comfortable grasp of how to write queries.</description>

      <title>Take Control with Resource Governor</title>
      <description>A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing the resources on their systems in order to ensure that they are being followed and resources are accessible when needed. SQL Server 2008 provides Resource Governor, which allows the DBA to discretely manage system resources in a very structured or not so structured way(Its your choice!). In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features to help lower your anxiety levels while increasing your system’s availability.</description>

      <title>Data Mining with Analysis Services </title>
      <description>Modern day computing power and SQL Server makes it possible to add sophisticated data mining models to our applications that forecast and predict, perform anomaly detection, and classify data. This presentation will demonstrate how to use Analysis Services to incorporate these complex algorithms seamlessly into your databases. Attendees will be shown how to create a data mining model using SSAS, how to use SSIS to query and load mining forecasts, and a sample web application that seamlessly uses a mining model. Take a step forward towards making BI pervasive in your organization by integrating data mining into your company’s applications...and learn how to win your fantasy football league and beat the stock market too!</description>

      <title>Be in control - Policy Based Management</title>
      <description>Getting a bit weary of developers or DBA's that cannot seem to follow well documented policies for naming conventions or server settings? Would you like to define these policies in a manner that allows SQL Server to ENFORCE them for you or, at the very least, monitor them? Policy-based management provides the ability to define policies that apply to servers, databases and other objects in your data environment. Well-defined policies can help you to control and manage change proactively.</description>
