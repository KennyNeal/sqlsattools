      <title>(SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage(Fuzzy Match)</title>
      <description>We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms.The steps are as follows: 1. Cleansing and standardization 2. Group records 3. Split records 4. Compare records and determine scores 5. Split into separate match categories 6. Analyze results of matches 7. Evaluate using match tools to determine if best algorithms have been combined. </description>

      <title>Drive SQL Server Performance: I/O For Developers</title>
      <description>An often-overlooked aspect to data optimization is what is happens under the covers – how does SQL Server store and access data?  There are plenty of common rules covering tuning, but this session looks at data access from the physical layer, detailing how table access and indexes work, showing why some designs perform poorly, and why adding more indexes may not help.  This will not be a discussion of normal forms or design rules. Instead, it will be a technical session providing the foundation for you to choose which concepts to apply to your designs.
  The session starts with the notion that SQL Server is not a magic box – most of what happens is well-documented and must be taken into consideration when designing or tuning databases.</description>

      <title>PowerPivot:  BI  Massive Data Analysis for Humans</title>
      <description>The paradox of Business Intelligence:  it's one of the few tech sectors that actually grows during recessions, and yet, satisfaction levels with BI investments remain on average quite poor.  Also, BI remains the domain of specialists, off-limits to most of us.  Why do these conditions persist when the funding, and therefore the business need, only continues to grow?

In this session I will demonstrate how PowerPivot is opening the world of BI to a broader audience ( range of applications).  The only prereqs: curiosity, and fondness for numbers :)

I will explain how PowerPivot impacts  benefits you depending on role (analyst, DBA, BI Pro, etc.), show off its capabilities in real-world usage, and field as many q's as you can muster :)</description>

      <title>Gathering and Interpreting Performance Metrics</title>
      <description>To begin tuning your system and the queries that run on it, you must begin from a position of knowledge. The knowledge I’m talking about is knowing what is occurring on your systems. What kind of load is the server under? How many times is that stored procedure called? This session will present the basics of gathering and interpreting knowledge about your server and the queries running on it. We’ll cover a variety of topics from performance monitor, to server-side traces, to dynamic management objects. We’ll go over how to set these things up to monitor your system and how to interpret the data returned from them. This session is part of a full day of training which will be presented in May at SQL Rally in Florida.</description>

      <title>As a DBA, Where Do I Start?!</title>
      <description>You've always wanted to get promoted into the DBA position. The good news is you got it - the bad news is you have no idea what to do first. What's important, what's not a big deal, and what can get you fired if you're not careful? If your answer wasn’t, “update my resume”, then this session is a good start. We’ll chat about a natural priority for the overwhelming flood waiting in our offices. By focusing on a few words ending in “ity” we’ll realize what is most important. Through the interaction, stories and examples you’ll leave feeling ready to attack your environment. Be warned – along the way to knowing where to start, you may get that feeling in your stomach that makes you log on to the VPN to check a few things out.</description>

      <title>Who's responsible? The vendor or the DBA?</title>
      <description>Database administrators - you don't really trust your third party software vendors, do you?  Software vendors - you think most of the DBAs out there are hiding things, don't you? Well guess what, you're both right!  Join Erin Stellato (representing vendors) and Mike Walsh (representing customers) for an interactive session where they will tackle some of the toughest challenges that DBAs and vendors face.  Attendees will walk out with a better understanding of what both parties can do to contribute to a successful relationship, as well as a set of fair questions to ask to set the right expectations from the start.  </description>

      <title>Using SQL Azure in an SSMS Addin</title>
      <description>The Cloud is fast becoming the latest hot topic in the technology arena.  We need to understand how we as SQL Developers and Administrators can utilize SQL Azure, Microsoft’s platform for relational data storage in the Cloud, to meet our needs.  It doesn’t always have to be full sites deployed to the Cloud, it could also be "hybrid solutions", with a Client tool accessing a Cloud database. That is what will be demonstrated in this talk:  A step-by-step demo of how to obtain an Azure subscription, create and administer a SQL Azure database, and work with it from your own SQL Server Management Studio Addin.  The end result is an Addin in SSMS that uses the SQL Azure Cloud as a common script repository.</description>

      <title>The "Tally" Table  High Speed "Pseudo Cursors"</title>
      <description>There are dozens of things we do in T-SQL which require some type of iteration. "Iteration" means "counters", "loops" and recursion to most people. To those well versed in the “Black Arts” of high performance "Set-based" programming, it means a "Numbers" or "Tally" Table, instead. This “Developer-to-Developer” session starts with the basics of how SQL Server can be tricked into counting faster than you can imagine, how that simple act of counting replaces slothful loops and other forms of “RBAR”, and provides a substantial introduction to “set based thinking. The session also includes tips on using Pseudo Cursors, CROSS APPLY, and INLINE TABLE VALUED FUNCTIONS (iTVFs) to make your code that much faster .  </description>

      <description>“The system is slow.  It was much faster last week!  This is taking forever.”  Statements like these from users can be frustrating for any DBA, unless you have the data to prove how the system regularly performs.  In this session we will cover some of the tools and techniques freely available to SQL Server DBAs for capturing baselines that can be used for measuring performance, capacity planning and understanding usage patterns.  We also discuss how these utilities and their data can be used to identify warning signs and troubleshoot performance issues.  Tools covered include: PerfMon, PAL, Profiler, ClearTrace, RMLUtils, who_is_active and SQL Server DMVs</description>

      <title>Table Partitioning: Evaluation, Planning, Options</title>
      <description>Does SQL Server's table partitioning feature offer performance improvements, manageability benefits, or both? Table partitioning is a significant investment: it's important to understand many aspects of the feature to evaluate where it will be useful. This session will cover basic concepts of table partitioning. We'll discuss where the feature can be applied, its benefits, and changes that partitioning may require to existing database schema. Special considerations for management of partitioned tables will be discussed, as well as potential changes to query optimization and plans. SQL Server 2008 R2 features for partitioning will be included in the discussion.</description>

      <title>Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions </title>
      <description>Every data warehouse needs a date dimension to help users slice and dice data. What should be included in the dimension, what is enough and what is too much? Should you use the wizard to generate the dimension for you; what are the advantages and disadvantages? We will explore a generic date dimension load script, loading a custom table and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time dimension. Finally we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make an Order Date, Ship Date, Received Date exposed to users as opposed to multiple date dimensions.

      <description>In this session we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

      <title>(NOLOCK) FOR YESFUN: Games with Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>Understanding transaction isolation levels is critical for developing concurrent software as well as administering databases. Unfortunately most of us learn about transaction isolation early in our careers and don't maintain an in-depth knowledge of different isolation levels. This talk will help! We'll cover all isolation levels and discuss problems and benefits. A broadsheet handout will keep your knowledge fresh later on. This is suitable for developers and DBAs at all levels.</description>

      <title>Service Broker...What's That  How Do I Use It?</title>
      <description>Have you heard of Service Broker?  Do you know what it is?  How about how to use it?  This session will answer these questions and more.  Service Broker is arguably one of the least known and used features of SQL Server.  We'll explore Service Broker and learn what it is and how it works.  We'll walk through the setup and configuration along with demonstrating its use.  You'll leave this session with a better understanding of Service Broker, its use and implementation, along with ideas of how you can implement it in your own environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis Services Troubleshooting and Optimization</title>
      <description>You've got SSAS cubes and they work. Now people are using them and everyone's queries are slow. I'll  cover how to see who's using the cubes, what query they're running. Also, what can we do to make the queries run faster and how to stop bad queries that are hogging system resources. Specifically I'll cover the SSAS DMVs, the SSAS Activity Viewer available from CodePlex that uses theses DMVs. Also the aggregation designer that is available as part of the BIDS  project and how it can be used to speed up queries against the cube database. </description>

      <title>Programming with FileStreams</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 introduced the FileStream object.  This allowed developers to resolve an age long dilemma of storing large binary files in the database or accessing them on the file system.  SS08 provides the best of both worlds while allowing applications to access the data readily through the FileStream object via Transact SQL or File I/O.

      <title>Gather SQL Server Performance Data with PowerShell</title>
      <description>We all know how important it is to keep a baseline of performance metrics that allow us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  We don't always know how to do this easily and consistently.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</description>

      <title>Take Your Automation Script to the Next Level</title>
      <description>How can PowerShell take SQL Server Automation to the next level?  PowerShell with the help of the SMO (Server Management Objects) allows a script to interact with the operation system and SQL Server at the same time.  In this session we will cover the basics of PowerShell and the SMO object model.  Then review a number of scripts that demonstrate the power of PowerShell when automating SQL Server tasks and can be used as building blocks for further automation.
