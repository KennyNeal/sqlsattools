      <title>Processing Flat Files with SSIS</title>
      <description>When doing data integration, a common requirement is to work with flat files, whether for importing data into a system from an external source, or to export it to provide to other systems. SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) supports flat files, but there can be a number of challenges when working with them. This is particularly true if your flat files have multiple data formats contained in a single file, the data has complex formatting, or the files have inconsistent formatting. This session will help you to be more efficient when working with these types of files. You’ll learn to handle missing delimiters in the files, and parsing files that have multiple data formats. </description>

      <title>Table Partitioning: Evaluation, Planning, Options</title>
      <description>Does SQL Server's table partitioning feature offer performance improvements, manageability benefits, or both? Table partitioning is a significant investment: it's important to understand many aspects of the feature to evaluate where it might be useful to applications. This session will cover basic concepts of table partitioning. We'll discuss where the feature can be applied, its benefits, and changes that partitioning may require to existing database schema. Special considerations for management of partitioned tables will be discussed, as well as potential changes to query optimization and plans. New SQL 2008 R2 features for partitioning will be included in the discussion.</description>

      <title>Partitioning in SQL Server 2005/2008</title>
      <description>Starting with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has made a significant effort to truly streamline partitioning data to be on par with industry leading databases like Oracle. The potential was not fully harnessed by the SQL Server community primarily due to the lack of any user interface associated with partitioning and due to lack of cohesive documentation. For many, Kimberly Tripp’s white paper on “Partitioned Tables and Indexes in SQL Server 2005” is generally regarded as a primary guiding source that bridges the void in MS documentation. Come and get a quick start on partitioning. It is simple and efficient. Manageability and performance come part and parcel.</description>

      <title>SQL and SEO - the FUZION of data and marketing</title>
      <description>Bringing marketing together with technology is a fine art that involves high tech tools, real life solutions, and most important human buy-in from the marketing and IT departments. This lecture will delve into the use of the latest SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 technologies including recursive common table expressions (CTE), hierarchical data models, and CLR stored procedures for the IT side of the house while also delving into the use of analytics, webmaster monitoring tools, web marketing tactics and search engine optimization techniques for the more marketing minded. Neither SQL nor SEO are four letter words and they go together perfectly! So too can your IT and marketing departments as you tackle the new age of IT Marketing.

      <title>Design and Implement BI Like Edison!</title>
      <description>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence solutions.

      <title>Data Files and Transaction Logs – Beyond the GUIs </title>
      <description>Performance of SQL Server poor?  One cause may have been that starting file size that you didn't think was important because it will auto-grow. Why is auto-grow bad? Why shouldn't files be auto-shrunk? Why keep that free space in the files?  Explore the physical structure of a database, how table structure effects use of memory and key mistakes to avoid. Additionally, dive into the transaction log process - VLFs, auto-recovery and lock escalation. Solid foundation for Programmers and Administrators! </description>

      <title>Automate Policy-Based Management using PowerShell</title>
      <description>The Policy-Based Management feature in SQL Server 2008 provides a great way to ensure your systems are configured consistently and correctly, but it can be tedious to implement on each server in your environment.  PowerShell scripts allow you to automate the implementation of your policies so you can focus on more important problems.  This session will walk you through how PBM works, how to define your policies in PowerShell, and how to set up Agent jobs to evaluate those policies regularly to let you know when you need to take action.</description>

      <description>There are number of tools available on the market for the SQL Server performance troubleshooting. But do we use the full power of the internal SQL Server Data Management Views (DMVs)? Some very challenging issues can be solved using DMVs. What the Dynamic Management Views are? How diagnostics data is getting populated? Using the examples we are going to talk about diagnostic data analysis using T-SQL queries against SQL Server DMVs.

      <title>SSIS for real: A walk through a real world project</title>
      <description>In this presentation I will walk though a complete real-world SSIS project that pulls data from an AS/400 and converts it to a SQL Server destination. In addition to specific AS/400 conversion issues I will also cover topics like dynamic OLEDB connections, and creating an effective work flow.  Along the way we'll take a look at how I use Derived Columns, Conditional Split, Lookup, and Script components to solve every day conversion issues.</description>

      <title>Intro to C# for the SSIS Script Component</title>
      <description>The Script Component is an extremely powerful element in SSIS because it brings in the full capability of the .NET Framework.  With first-class development tools and languages like C# you can solve problems that previously required very complex SQL or Expressions.  If you'd like to learn enough C# to more effectively use the Script Component for Transformations, then this session is for you.</description>

      <title>Writing faster queries</title>
      <description>Poor database performance is Achilles' heel of any system.  Better and faster hardware can improve systems to a certain point.  However, for truly great performing systems, there is no substitute for properly written queries and designed indexes.  In this session we'll take a look at some common query performance killers, along with some no so obvious things that we can do to our queries to make them as fast as possible.</description>

      <title>A better way to store and archive SQL Backups</title>
      <description>How do you verify your daily backup can be restored? What if you need to restore a backup from several days ago instead of the latest? How many backups should you keep? I've adopted a Tower of Hanoi tape rotation schedule to meet our disk-to-disk backup needs, at first that sounds simple but it's actually MUCH more complex than it sounds - Learn about the strategy I use, the scripts we use to backup (with reports of success/failure and automatic retries for any failure), how we validate backups, and how we decide which backups to keep and which we erase to free up disk space. </description>

      <description>This talk will give you an introduction into monitoring SQL Server using Policy Based Management and Central Management System which is provided out of the box with SQL Server 2008. I will then show you how you can combine these features with the Enterprise Policy Management Framework on codeplex to provide monitoring for your whole SQL Server farm.  This topic assumes you know nothing about PBM and CMS and will include lots of examples with only a few PowerPoint slides.
