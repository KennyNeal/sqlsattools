      <title>Introducing Microsoft's EDIM Products</title>
      <description>Starting in the SQL Server Denali release, data takes on a new life in the business intelligence world.  Often forgotten, data management needs to be an integral part of your reporting systems.  Learn how Microsoft has made your life easier by incorporating external parameters, environments, and groupings into Integration Services.  They have also included impact analysis and data lineage, which can be tied to tables and SSIS packages.  Two additional newcomer products, data quality services and master data services, complete the quartet.  This session will use the first Community Technical Preview of SQL Server Denali to describe and demonstrate the enhancements to the four products that make up EDIM.</description>

      <title>ORM's and the ugly truth</title>
      <description>In this session, we are going to take a surgical approach to why I as a DBA fear ugly ORM's. Even though you can use views and stored procs as plastic surgery for an ugly case of ORM, there is only so much you can do if it is ugly on the inside. Slides generally bore me, so we will only be looking at a couple before we put on our scrubs and hit the OR(M) to perform an uglyectomy to create an ORM we can live with.

Technologies: I'll be using Entity Framework 4, Linq, MVC2 and a variety of virtual surgical tools.
I ranked this session as beginner with regards to the topic of ORM's. My session makes assumptions you know about execution plans, traces, the optimizer and other non-beginner topics in SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Stored procedure tracing using the xml datatype</title>
      <description>When running a stored procedure it is difficult to record what is happening. In this session we will develop logger code in T-SQL to add to your stored procedures. We will use the xml datatype to record parameter values, variable values and debug statements. We will look at the "For xml" statement as well as the xml datatype methods, especially the modify method.  Finally we will look at how to read the logs when finished.</description>

      <title>Parallel Data Warehouse - Architecture Overview</title>
      <description>In Nov.2010, Microsoft officially released SQL Server 2008 R2 PDW Edition. Parallel Data Warehouse is a true MPP (massive parallel processing) platform featuring an ultra shared nothing architecture.  PDW is capable of delivering very fast query performance and can house up to 500 TB of data.
This session will overview both the HW and SW architecture of the PDW appliance.  It will explain how Microsoft and HP have engineered a solution using commodity HW and SW that can compete with more expensive platforms like TeraData and ExaData.  Additionally, SQL DBAs will see where their current skillset is applicable to managing a PDW appliance.</description>

      <title>SSRS data driven subscription using SSIS</title>
      <description>SQL Server Reporting Services provides a powerful tool to render report based on information in a database table.  But in order to use this feature, you are required to purchase an Enterprise license of SQL Server.  In this session, we will create an SSIS package that renders reports based on the results of a query.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Profiler and SQL Trace</title>
      <description>Profiler (and its underlying subsystem, SQL Trace) is a tool for recording a SQL Server instance's activity. This diagnostic and performance data is valuable for troubleshooting and characterizing a system's workload. Like any powerful tool, misuse can be quite harmful, so great care must be exercised. This session will teach you how to efficiently configure, run, and analyze the data from traces, while minimizing the overhead of the data collection and avoiding common pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Building a Professional Development Plan</title>
      <description>A good professional development plan has to go far beyond ‘learning more technology’, it has to encompass the wide variety of skills you need to build the next step in your career, and it has to include a variety of learning methods. We’ll discuss how much time and money you should budget when building your plan, and how the distribution of time and money changes as your career evolves. We’ll look at the growth phases you’ll encounter, learning how you learn best, how to keep up with new technology without burning out, and even how things like blogging and Twitter can be an interesting part of your plan.

      <title>Zero to cube in 1 hour</title>
      <description>In this session, we'll walk through the steps for creating a multidimensional schema (star schema) for a subject area we're all familiar with, load the tables we create via SSIS, and build an SSAS cube to facilitate analytical analysis. The session is almost completely demo-driven, and will hopefully inspire you to go home and build your first BI solution to facilitate your own analysis.</description>
