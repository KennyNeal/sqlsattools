      <title>Visual Report Design: Bringing Sexy Back</title>
      <description>Do your users have the same old, mundane table reports they’ve been using for decades? Stop living in the past and make your reports pop. Learn to use design patterns, best practices and visuals that pack more usable information into fewer, more usable reports. Use Reporting Services and other Microsoft BI tools to create dynamic, browse-able reports that answer important business questions at a glance and then let business users explore the details to gain insight and take action. Sure, Business Intelligence is all the rage but you don’t have to invest in an entire BI platform to have fresh, usable reports. With a little simple programming code, these design techniques apply to big analytic solutions  smaller-scale operational reports.</description>

      <title>Women in Technology</title>
      <description>Most women working in technology keep a low profile, rarely standing out, rarely pushing the extra effort that typically denotes excellence.  Women are constantly juggling to find the balance between career and family –with added complexity when children are involved.   Come and learn about the three essential career considerations for Women in Technology.   Understanding and applying these considerations can help you get to the next level of excellence in your career and family life. Men who understand these considerations can better support the women members in their life.   I will share some of my own experiences, challenges, and lessons learned as I have learned how to balance career, family, and life in general.</description>

      <title>Row Level Security and SQL-CLR integration</title>
      <description>RLS (Row Level Security) is often integral part of EDW (Enterprise Data Warehouse) design.  There are many ways to implement RLS. This is the story about our evolution of RLS implementation and how SQL-CLR integration helped us solve technical difficulty.</description>

      <title>Self Service BI in SQL Server 2008 R2 (PowerPivot)</title>
      <description>There are many IT pros who know all the snazzy tools to create fantastic reports.  The users who know the data inside and out may not know those tools, but odds are that they know Excel.  Microsoft has released PowerPivot which seems to bridge the gap between the two worlds.  These power users can now create their own fantastic reports within PowerPivot.  We will explore what PowerPivot is and how can use it to create a self-service business intelligence solution.  </description>

      <title>Strategies for Working with VLDBs</title>
      <description>Very large databases (VLDBs) are just like regular databases, right? There's just more of them to love. Working with very large databases can be difficult and tricky at times. Everything takes longer and minor issues become major very quickly. In this session you will learn some strategies for working with VLDBs such as how to speed up backups and restores, how to minimize your maintenance window requirements, and how to efficiently and quickly set up failover partners and replicas. Demos will include how I set up a log shipping secondary and a replica of a 2 TB database in less than half an hour.</description>

      <title>Basic Performance Tips and Gotchas</title>
      <description>Forget Profiler for a second, I have seen one poorly placed index bring an enterprise database to its knees. We will cover the basic tips of performance which always work and the ones which always fail. What can you do – and what should you do – when it comes to the most common types of indexes so you always make the right move. We will use lessons from SQL Programming Joes 2 Pros.</description>

READ: very little PowerPoint time. SSIS is a high performance ETL solutions introduced in SQL Server 2005 to replace SQL Server's DTS functionality. ETL? It's okay, Scott will briefly cover some of these concepts too. Relax, sit back and learn how to simplify your "Extract, Transform, and Load" processes.</description>

      <title>Managing Sparse Resources with Resource Governor</title>
      <description>A large majority of a modern DBA's workload consists of managing the resources on their systems in order to ensure that they are being followed and resources are accessible when needed. SQL Server 2008 provides Resource Governor, which allows the DBA to discretely manage system resources in a very structured way. In this session, we will show you how to configure, monitor, and administer these features as well as demonstrate some of the pitfalls and helpful hints that you will need in order to successfully implement this fascinating tool. </description>

      <title>Through the Looking-Glass </title>
      <description>"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There" - When your world is SQL Server, you need a looking-glass to determine server health, diagnosis problems, and tune performance. In this session will we follow Alice through the looking-glass to determine what she finds in SQLServerLand. Alice will be using dynamic management views and functions (DMVs) to explore the land behind the looking-glass. She will find statistics, poorly performing queries, and much more. Follow Alice and her new friends, as she traverses across SQLServerLand and provides you with snippets of T-SQL code that you can use to explore your own SQLServerLand.

      <title>Inside and out of Transactional Replication</title>
      <description>Replication in SQL Server is great tool for scaling out your master database(s) onto other servers for reporting and remote site access with near real-time data propagation. In this session, I will cover LAN and WAN data replication tricks-of-the-trade to offload work from your master servers. Using these techniques, you can improve your performance and monitoring of your existing installations or gain knowledge and confidence to implement new solution for your company.</description>

      <description>Powershell is a very powerful management tool and you can spend hours writing magical scripts to do all the things you want. Frequently forgotten is the Powershell profile, a place you can add your own functions which can provide you lightening fast access to information. We'll talk about the power a profile puts at your fingertips. I will also demo (and share) a bunch of short functions that I use frequently for common tasks. I'll show you my Powershell profile if you show me yours.

      <title>Get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition</title>
      <description>How can you get the most out of SQL Server Standard Edition? The SQL Server Enterprise Edition (EE) is far more expensive than the Standard Edition (SE). Many small office applications use SE. What features do you really need for your database system? Many features that are only available in EE, such as partitioning and data compression, are specific to managing larger databases. If you do not have very large databases, perhaps SE will be sufficient. Find out what actually improves performance for SE.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Data Changes with Change Data Capture </title>
      <description>Most modern enterprise database environments require some measure of auditing their data. Previously, the DBA would need to put together a complicated web of triggers and history tables in order to properly track data changes. Now in SQL Server 2008, Change Data Capture allows the DBA to readily enact a very straight-forward method for tracking the changes and understanding easily how they took place. In this session, we will examine how to set-up, configure, use, and administer the Change Data Capture process in your environment.</description>

The focus will be on the DB side, with minor context given to the web and middle tier pieces necessary for each system to work.  Note that this is reporting in the sense of generating end user reports (not using SSRS).</description>
