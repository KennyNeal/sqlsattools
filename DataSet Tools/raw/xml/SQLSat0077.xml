Here are a few suggestions in this chapter to make you feel even better. Of course, more work is needed. Getting your app noticed in marketplace will not happen automatically or optimally by publishing alone. There specific suggestions I will offer up to help the cause. So, grab a deep breath and get ready to settle in and focus on making more money. Make all the time you have invested so far, well worth it. Many of the suggestions are common sense when you think them through, but are a few I found out the hard way and hopefully will save you some pain.

      <title>Table Vars and Temp Tables: What you NEED to know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, 'When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>T-SQL Awesomeness: 3 Ways to Write Cool SQL</title>
      <description>There’s nothing quite as satisfying as writing a cool bit of T-SQL. Luckily for us, there are some truly awesome ways to make your data do just what you need it to do, while improving performance and/or readability. 

Come learn three new-school ways to expand your T-SQL repertoire with: • Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE) • EXCEPT and INTERSECT • CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY 

We will look at data models and scenarios you might encounter that lend themselves to these techniques, see old-school ways to solve T-SQL challenges, and then compare them to newer, leaner ways to get the same result set. Impress your friends and confound your frenemies with your mad T-SQL skills. </description>

      <title>Transition from DBA to BI Architect </title>
      <description>Database Normalization and Dimension Modeling are the same but different. Development in today ‘s larger industries require the design and analysis of Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to take into account Data Warehousing/OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). My transition from Senior DBA to BI Architect at Amedisys has been a process of sanding the rough edges of my passion from fully normalized databases. The Dimensional Modeling started a re-tooling of my mind to look at end result analytics/statistics from smaller and smaller transactions. From previous experience, I know I am not going to get it right the first time. Lessons learned will mold me into a great BI Guy.

      <title>Design and Implement BI Like Edison! </title>
      <description>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.

      <title>Attribute Discretization in Analysis Services (BI)</title>
      <description>Attribute discretization is an oft-overlooked feature in Analysis Services that allows us to automatically create a manageable number of groups of attribute values that are clearly separated by boundaries. Discretization can help us to make it easier for information consumers to work with large numbers of possible attribute member values. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson discusses the varied options, the design (and other) considerations involved, and best practices surrounding the use of this capability. </description>

Using this library we can build tools to automate daily tasks and even build apps that might not be easy to do or even possible with SSMS/TSQL.  In this session I will teach you, the non-programmer DBA, how to build an SMO application that performs some SQL Server health checks and reports back to you in a nice GUI tool.  We will go over some basic OOP information but the bulk of this session will be hands on building/demoing. No .NET experience is required. The less experience you have with .NET development the better!!</description>

      <title>Revenge: The SQL!</title>
      <description>Have you been wronged, cheated, lied to, lied about, or deceived by a coworker?  Feel like your DBA position offers no opportunity for revenge?  WRONG!

This session is a light-hearted exploration of some delightfully mischievous SQL design patterns that will annoy, aggravate, and antagonize anyone who has to work with them.  (But they deserved it!)  Learn how to:  create tables with no names; columns with duplicate names; and write perfectly valid yet utterly nonsensical SQL.  You may never get to use these techniques…but you'll ache for the chance!</description>

      <description>Like the title says, be prepared to get really down and dirty with memory allocations and usage in SQL Server. RAM is one of the three pillars of server performance and understanding how it is used, how you can analyze what is going on with it and how to properly adjust the the few knobs you have at your disposal are very important topics for both your server's health and performance.</description>

      <description>Ever wanted to create clones of yourself to get all your work done faster? I will demonstrate how SSIS can help you perform your DBA tasks as if there were more than one of you. You will leave the session knowing how to use SSIS to automate tasks such as performance monitoring above (and below) the normal health checks and transporting databases from one environment to another. You will also learn how SSIS can be used in assisted HA and DR failover strategies as well as backup solutions that go beyond the simple BACKUP statement. We’re going to take SSIS and make it a standard tool for your administrative tasks!

      <description>In this session we will look at examining execution plans as a method for performance tuning. With the execution plan we can see the exact type of operation performed, and, more than that, we can look at the differences in what the optimizer thought the query would cost vs what it actually cost to perform the query. By examining the plans we have a road map for determining what type of improvements we should be striving for in order to make the particular statement more optimal.</description>

      <description>Originally released with Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework v4, Entity Framework v4 has seen a remarkable evolution in the past year or so. In April, Microsoft released version 4.1. Most notably, there is now great support for Code First development. This talk will delve into the use of Code First in Entity Framework v4.1 and will be very code focused. Developers will learn how they can use the Entity Framework APIs to create applications that use Entity Framework features to access relational databases without the need to use designers to create the model. It is in essence a "code only" approach, which has many benefits, including for testability and long-term evolution of your code.</description>
