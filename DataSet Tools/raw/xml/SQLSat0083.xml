      <title>Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance</title>
      <description>This session will show you how a better understanding of how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your queries. I will show you some of the top Query Optimizer topics that can give you the most benefit by focusing both on concepts and practical solutions. Several areas of the query processor will be covered, everything from troubleshooting query performance problems and identifying what information the Query Optimizer needs to do a better job to the extreme cases where, because of the its limitations, the Query Optimizer may not give you a good plan and you may need to take a different approach.</description>

      <title>Get your Oracle data into SQL Server faster!</title>
      <description>In this session, we will explore the usage and performance of the Microsoft Connector Version 1.1 for Oracle by Attunity.  Delegates will leave the session empowered to replace their current SQL Server Integration Packages to use the new connector to dramatically increase data transfer speed between SQL Server and Oracle.  The session is a must for BI developers working in heterogeneous environments where Oracle source systems or Data Warehouses and Microsoft BI tools co-exist.</description>

      <title>Recursive Queries: Beautiful Events Always Recur </title>
      <description>(Eng  Afrikaans)
Within the realm of financial instruments, business structure and rules are highly hierarchical in nature. Investor funds consist of one or many levels of asset ID’s which in turn are comprised of one or more lots. This certainly poses interesting challenges when it comes to creating efficient and effective detailed and summary level queries and reports. This beginners' to intermediate level hands-on presentations is aimed at showing the attendee how we handle recursive scenarios,utilizing several techniques including, recursive T-SQL, code using memory TABLEs (as custom stacks) and CTE's.</description>

      <title>Baseline my Database</title>
      <description>As a DBA I always get asked by my  DBA peers “How many I/Os, Deadlocks, Scans etc. does your database perform?”. Very valid question but in what context? The starting point of answering the context questions starts with implementing a baseline for your database. In this session I will propose concepts and raise important things to consider when implementing a baseline on a production database.</description>

      <title>12 ways to write badly performing T-SQL</title>
      <description>Database performance is a hot topic and there are often questions asked pertaining to the best way to write T-SQL queries. 

In this presentation, the attendee will NOT be shown the best manner in which to write queries but rather numerous ways of how to write poorly performing queries, with the hope that the attendee  will obtain an understanding of what NOT to do.  

The user will be guided through each query, be shown why it’s not the optimal way of doing things and then shown a well-written query that achieves the same results.
