      <title>Developing Date and Role-Playing Dimensions</title>
      <description>Let's go from Cradle to Grave with the one dimension in 99.99999% of cubes, the dreaded Date dimension.  Without this dimension users wouldn't know if it is worth staying open on a holiday or which day of the week the most fresh produce ships or even what their bonus will be.  What should be included in the dimension? Should you use the wizard to generate? In this session, we will explore a generic date dimension load script and configuring SSAS to use the table as the time  dimension.  We will explore performance considerations of attribute hierarchies compared with usability benefits of user hierarchies. Finally, we will address the advantages of role-playing dimensions to make Order Date, Ship Date and Received Date dimensions.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment</title>
      <description>When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.</description>

      <title>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>(SSIS, TSQL and MDS) - Record Linkage Fuzzy Match</title>
      <description>We will implement several code samples based on a series of articles amd posts identifying similar records between two different sources or grouping of records from a single source, based on existing column string of values. We will define an approach, review actual implementations with various SQL tools(TSQL, VB,SSIS and MDS). There are many facets to review. I would like to start by drawing concepts from several articles from experienced practitioners, either from academia or the commercial market. They will be footnoted at the end of the session. Although we are discussing matching, we need to address several steps prior to getting to the actual use of matching algorithms</description>

      <title>Banish RBAR!</title>
      <description>SQL Server is primarily designed for set-based operations, so code that performs Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) operations is going against the design, rather than working with it. Come to this code filled session, where we will examine several recent additions to SQL Server, and learn how the vast majority of RBAR code can be replaced with efficient, set-based code. Learn how the APPLY operator works; iterate through incoming data just once with the MERGE statement; “slice and dice” your data with the Windowing (ranking) functions; re-write your multi-statement table-valued functions to inline functions to help the optimizer and speed up your queries; learn how to create a grouped delimited list – without loops!</description>

      <title>Introduction to Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Microsoft’s SQL Server Analysis Services is best known for its ability to build and manage OLAP data cubes.  In addition to that core functionality, SSAS enables users to define key performance indicators (KPIs), profile data, mine data and predict future activities using the results of that mining.  Perhaps best of all, SSAS is included as part of SQL Server 2008 Standard and Enterprise Editions.  This session introduces the audience to the capabilities of SSAS, businesses uses for those tools and ways to integrate SSAS with Integration Services and Reporting Services.</description>

      <title>Change Data Capture in SQL Server 2008</title>
      <description>In this session, I'll  talk about Change Data Capture (CDC) terminology and configuring a database for Change Data Capture.  I'll show how to read CDC log tables, and show CDC code samples. I'll  discuss CDC and SQL Server Agent jobs, and the use of CDC versus database triggers (and where triggers are still needed). Also, the impact of CDC on the transaction log and system performance will be explored. Finally, I'll talk about how to deal with schema changes, performance tuning, and using CDC in an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) environment with SQL Server Integration Services.

      <description>Performance of SQL Server poor?  One cause may have been that starting file size that you didn't think was important because it will auto-grow. Why is auto-grow bad? Why shouldn't files be auto-shrunk? Why keep that free space in the files?  Explore the physical structure of a database, how table structure effects use of memory and key mistakes to avoid. Additionally, dive into the transaction log process - VLFs, auto-recovery and lock escalation. Solid foundation for Programmers and Administrators! </description>

      <title>Windows Failover Clustering Basics for the DBA</title>
      <description>While you can see how to run through Wizards deploy a failover cluster in 60 minutes in other places, what a DBA really needs is a solid foundation of Windows to truly be able to understand that implementation and its subsequent administration. This session will demystify the Windows layer of clustering and present it from a DBA focus. Using Windows Server 2008 R2, some of the topics that will be shown are: failover cluster validation and its impact on installing SQL Server, a tour of the new Failover Cluster Manager and how it can be used for administration, using the new cluster logs for troubleshooting, and more.</description>

      <title>Mining XML Query Plans</title>
      <description>Execution plans contain a lot of information that can guide you in your performance tuning process. Since SQL 2005 it is possible to retrieve the execution plans stored in the cache using DMVs and DMFs. However, as they are stored in XML format it can be cumbersome and difficult to extract the information you need. In this session, you will learn how the XML query plan is structured and how to use SQL Server’s built-in XQuery language to extract information. Examples include indexes that the optimizer indicates would increase performance if implemented and queries that use table scans or nested loop joins.</description>

Understanding how indexes are structured can then help understand how they can help improve query performance by reducing lookups, serving as a covering index, etc.  The session will use DBCC Page/Ind to look at how different types of indexes are structured and make some suggestions on the best way to structure tables, keys, and indexes to get the best performance from them.  Will also cover index options that can affect how indexes are structured and how Index Rebuild/Reorg work at the physical level.</description>

      <title>How to Increase Development Productivity in SSRS</title>
      <description>Using SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services and Report Builder 3.0, report writers can store, re-use, and modify pieces of reports using "report parts". Report parts are stored on the report server and are provided to others for collaboration in a report part library to increase initial development productivity and decrease maintenance turn-around time. This presentation will describe how to set up a user-friendly and easily maintained report part library by discussing how to create report parts, how to store them on the report server, and how to import them into a new report.</description>

      <title>Thwarting Database Defects</title>
      <description>It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them. This presentation introduces tSQLt, a framework for automated database unit testing. You’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. </description>

      <title>Designing an SSIS Framework </title>
      <description>In this “demo-tastic” presentation, SSIS trainer, author, and consultant Andy Leonard explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and centralizes logging. Key takeaways: 1) Developers can migrate packages from Development, through their lifecycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Managers properties. 2) A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution. 3) Demonstration of a centralized logging reporting application.</description>

      <title>Optimizing SQL Server I/O with Solid State Drives</title>
      <description>Optimal configuration and maintenance of the I/O subsystem is critical and can ultimately be responsible for higher response times of your applications. The HDDs are by design about 1 million times slower than the memory or CPU. In this session we analyze the different options that exist for durable storage, what are their pros and cons . Solid state drives are a viable option and we are going under the covers to see how you can best use them as an alternative to a large and expensive SAN in your infrastructure</description>
