      <title>Custom assemblies for Reporting Services</title>
      <description>With SSRS we can quickly generate reports that can be exported to multiple formats.  What happens when you want to extend your report  with custom code?  Perhaps you need a custom authentication layer, custom access to data requiring .Net code, or you want to extend some of the controls that come out of the box with SSRS.
In this session we will see an example of extending SSRS  to use a .Net library for a data provider allowing us to use a custom .Net business layer for our report.  We will also show an example extension to the SSRS graph control allowing us to make design graphs for SSRS.  Custom code is a great alternative for those considering using toolkits like Nevron or Dundas toolkits to extend their SSRS graphing capabilities</description>

      <title>Merge Replication for Offline Data Mobility</title>
      <description>How many times have you been sitting in a meeting and you hear, “We want all our users to have access to the data, 24/7. That includes when they are offline and on a client location”. At this point you may start letting out a large sigh because you are thinking, “How could the user get to the data if there is no connection?” This isn’t as hard as you may think and this session will show how to use SQL Servers Merge Replication in order to accomplish the task. Merge replication offers a scalable option for data mobility. This session will go over how Merge Replication can be used to replicate data to users that spend many hours offline.

      <title>High-Availability and DR Options for SQL Server</title>
      <description>A comparison of SQL HA  DR options, by a practitioner who has implemented  managed all the SQL HA and DR approaches ( various combinations thereof). Tim is an operational SQL DBA, who keeps SQL servers up  running  optimized for managed-services customers. We will compare trade-offs between the various SQL HA  DR options: for complexity, usability, hardware, licensing, failover speed, initial costs, ongoing support costs, staff skill requirements, etc. And we’ll briefly cover some of the upcoming SQL Denali HA / DR features.

      <title>Uniting Free Government Data using PowerPivot</title>
      <description>In recent years, governments throughout the world have made large volumes of data available for public use.  Vast data with detailed insights into verticals such as healthcare, census, weather, natural resources, land use, financial markets, and economics are available to be extracted, transformed, joined and unleashed.  In this session PowerPivot will be used to tie data together for analysis.  Examples include uniting commodity prices with weather patterns, integrating free healthcare data with economic data, and integrating US economic data with that of other countries.</description>

We will also discuss what’s changed in the 2010 release (including with the latest SP1 update).  Along with this we will go over the Dashboard Designer tool showing you how to install it and explain what it is used for.  Then hold on to your seats, I will build out and deploy a fully functional and interactive dashboard.  Along the way I will provide insight from the trenches including tips and tricks along with experience from client deployments.</description>

      <title>Minimal Processing for Large Cubes</title>
      <description>Processing large cubes can consume vast amounts of IO, and create lengthy response times.  This presentation will demo how to process dimensions and dynamically create, process, and delete measure group partitions to minimize IO.  By taking control of cube processing through a SSIS package you are able to process only the bare minimum in order to bring a cube current while keeping response times acceptable.  Additional areas to cover will include the support tables to control cubes, and a review of the XMLA for creating, processing, and deleting.</description>

      <title>Database Restores - Lessons from the Real World</title>
      <description>Having consistent, regular, verified backups are only a starting point. When failures happen - and they will happen - can you recover your database?  In this presentation we will dive into the mechanics of database restores and discuss how choices made previously in database/server/backup design can have profound effects on how ( what) you can recover.  We will also discuss spectacular ways to fail miserably... all in the hopes of preventing those same failures in the future.

      <description>Security is a vital part of any business intelligence solution. Unfortunately, creating a solution that presents users only with the information they should see can be a challenge. In this session we’ll look at how the various security pieces come together to make the solution work. We’ll cover configuring Kerberos for securing SSRS, SSAS, and SharePoint; Scripting permissions in SSAS using MDX, Active Directory groups, and SSIS; and finally, configuring SharePoint, PerformancePoint services, and Power Pivot services to access user’s data by passing Windows credentials and/or the use of data sources with execution accounts.</description>

      <description>It turns out there might be something better than the combination of beer and peanuts (at work anyway); using Powershell to gather Performance Monitor (perfmon) metrics!  In this session we will tackle gathering all the perfmon counters, storing them and alerting when they reach a defined level.  This will be a demo intensive session that will also use SQL and XML components of Powershell.  Attendees will leave this session with ideas and examples that they can implement in their jobs immediately.  A basic working knowledge of Powershell syntax and commandlets will be assumed.
