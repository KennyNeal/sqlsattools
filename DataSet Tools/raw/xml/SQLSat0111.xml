      <title>Query Tuning Mastery: Manhandling Parallelism</title>
      <description>In today's multi-core-driven world, query performance is very much determined by how well you're taking advantage of the processing power at your disposal. In this session you will learn how to take full advantage of parallelism, from a developer's point of view. After a quick terminology review and technology refresher the session will go deep, covering T-SQL patterns that allow certain queries to scale almost linearly across your multi-core CPUs. Not all T-SQL queries can go parallel, so you'll also learn to watch for those things that can restrict the query optimizer's decisions. Along the way you'll learn to manipulate costs and row goals, challenge generally accepted tuning practices, and take complete control of your parallel queries.</description>

      <title>Super-size Your SSIS Breakfast Sandwich: Performan</title>
      <description>Importing data is as common to SQL Server as bacon is to a savory breakfast sandwich. As most of us love to eat those breakfast sandwiches, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) loves to eat data in an Import/Export kind of way. Although a green chain of boxes in SSIS can be the ruling “Happy Dance” of any DBA or SQL Developer, we must still consider the performance of those tasks. In this session, we will go through performance tuning in SSIS 2012 after a successful SSIS package has been developed. When we are finished with this session, not only will you still have the mystic of green colors of successful execution of your SSIS import and export tasks, but the turbo boosters will be turned on as well.

      <title>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

Your first day at the job your boss walks you through some new job duties. He wants you to remote out to the server to look at the file directory where the FTP process writes the encrypted files  make sure the file share didn’t disappear when the cluster failed over. You slip away to the bathroom, lock yourself in a stall, have a seat and rock side to side muttering -What is he talking about?I thought there would be tables.

      <description>So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report.  It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities.  Did I mention they want it pretty as well?  In this session we will discuss how to use SQL Reporting Services 2008 R2 to bring it all together while avoiding the pit falls and mistakes.  The demonstration will show how to build a multi-page, dashboard style report to manage your report server showing a multitude of grids and charts.  We will discuss the challenges with data reuse and formatting while exploring techniques for getting them to work.  To get the most out of this session, you should be able to build a report in SSRS.</description>

      <description>Benchmarking, Baselines and Monitoring Storage
There are several steps in the life cycle of your storage systems. We have several tools to help us understand our storage systems from initial deployment through its useful life. 
We will cover:
SQLIO, a specific SQL Server benchmarking tool.
Iometer, a general IO benchmarking tool and simulator.
SQLIOSim a specific SQL Server base lining tool and simulator. 
TPC style testing focused on TPC-C, TPC-E and TPC-H.
Monitoring your system using WMI and virtual file stats.
Finally, what it all really means, how to read these results and compare them with each other.
With these tools you can plan, deploy and manage your storage for years to come!</description>

      <title>PowerScripting Live! (PowerShell podcast / BoF)</title>
      <description>Do you listen to podcasts? It's like the radio, but more Internetty. Well, Atlanta just so happens to be the home to the two co-hosts of the PowerScripting Podcast, the first podcast devoted to talking about Windows PowerShell. We have news, interviews, tips and resources that we present every week at powerscripting.net, but this time, the show is coming to you live! We'll come prepared to hit most any general PowerShell topic you want, and we'll probably sneak some SQL + PowerShell experts on stage to help out. This won't be a canned lecture, it will be more of a Birds of a Feather or talk show feel. Audience participation is REQUIRED!</description>

      <title>Manage SQL Server 2012 on Server Core w/PowerShell</title>
      <description>Windows Server 2008 introduced Server Core, the operating system without the Graphical User Interface. SQL Server 2012 is the first version of SQL Server to support Server Core. To gain the maximum efficiency from your servers you want to make use of Server Core and with PowerShell you can effectively manage SQL Server in that environment. This session will demonstrate how to manage SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server Core and provide scripts to help you perform the common tasks you need to perform on that platform.</description>

      <title>Being the Swiss Army Knife of DB Pros</title>
      <description>Being a specialist means you're really, really good at one thing. Being a generalist means you're good at a a lot of different things. The generalist has an advantage over the specialist because he or she can see and solve problems the specialists can't. In this session I'll cover why it's important to diversify your skill set, not only for career protection, but to be better as a database professional. We'll look at what skill sets to build on to expand your abilities around SQL Server to include the operating system, development, networks, and security. Remember, this saying isn't complete, "Jack of all trades, master of none." The full saying is, "Jack of all trades, master of none, though often times better than master of one."</description>

      <title>Working with Server Side Traces</title>
      <description>You may have heard that it’s a good idea to use a server-side trace to capture SQL profiler data, but do you know how to create one? And, do you know how to process the data you’ve captured?  If not, then this session is for you.

First, we’ll examine the anatomy of a server-side trace script and look at the different ways it can be customized. Then, we’ll talk about methods for stopping and starting the trace, how to know what traces are already running, and ways to schedule a trace to start under certain server conditions. Last, we’ll look at different tools available to you for analyzing the data you’ve gathered, including the SQL Server Profiler client application, “home-grown” T-SQL queries, ClearTrace, and the ReadTrace.</description>

      <title>Introduction to SQL Server Column-Level Encryption</title>
      <description>With the new data security standards and legislation, encryption has become a necessity in today’s business world. This session will introduce SQL Server column-level encryption and show how it can easily be implemented as part of a comprehensive security initiative (even in SQL Server Express Edition!). The session will include slides and discussions to introduce concepts and will also have a live demo of a simple implementation of column-level encryption. This is intended for anyone who is interested in SQL Server encryption, or those who need to implement column-level security in their databases as part of their overall database information security strategy.

      <title>Analytical Master Data Management with MDS 2012</title>
      <description>Recent changes in Business Intelligence have placed greater emphasis on on enabling end-user analytics. While compelling in theory, in practice there are many challenges when creating a foundation that supports end-users analytics. Many of these challenges revolve around making consistent reference (i.e. dimensional) data available to end users. This can be addressed using a Master Data Management solution.

This session session will explore ways that Master Data Services 2012 can be used to support the definition and management of master data used to support analytics (BI) solutions. It will start with a high level overview of MDM and MDS 2012, and finish with a demo of an analytical MDM solution.</description>

This session will give you great insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are some best practices for configuring TEMPDB, and how to determine if you have contention. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session. </description>

      <title>Report Parts: Increasing Productivity Since 2008R2</title>
      <description>Using SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services and Report Builder 3.0, report writers can store, re-use, and modify pieces of reports using "report parts". Report parts are stored on the report server and are provided to others for collaboration in a report part library to increase initial development productivity and decrease maintenance turn-around time. This presentation will describe how to set up a user-friendly and easily maintained report part library by discussing how to create report parts, how to store them on the report server, and how to import them into a new report.</description>

      <title>Introduction to FileTables</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 introduces the first significant enhancement to FILESTREAM: FileTables. FileTables use the underlying FILESTREAM storage, but expose the stored data using traditional Windows file I/O APIs. In addition, they also support hierarchical data storage (read "folders"). This session will show how to set up your SQL Server instance to support FileTables, how to create a FileTable and how to access it using standard Windows file APIs.
It may be valuable to attend the Introduction to FILESTREAM session also.</description>

      <title>Applied Enterprise Semantic Mining</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 debuts a new Semantic Platform (commonly known as the applied task, Semantic Search). This text mining technology leverages the already established Full Text Index, and builds semantic indexes in a two-phase process. This presentation provides a science description and demo for the Enterprise implementation of Tag Index and Document Similarity Index. At present (RC0), the indexes work for 15 languages. Included are strategy tips for how to best leverage the technology along with already-existing Microsoft text mining and data mining.</description>

      <title>Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!</title>
      <description>In a world…where DBAs are blamed, mistreated, and overworked…one man….WILL. GET. EVEN.  In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up.  Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, hiding and obfuscating data and code, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem.  And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!</description>

      <title>Working with "Biggish Data"</title>
      <description>Most database professionals know (from firsthand experience) that there continues to be a "data explosion", and there's been a lot of focus lately on "big data".  But what do you do when your data's just kind of "biggish"?  You're managing Terabytes, not Petabytes, and you're trying to squeeze out as much performance out of your aging servers as possible.  The focus of this session is to identify some key guidelines for the design, management, and ongoing optimization of "larger-than-average" databases. Special attention will be paid to the following areas: * query design * logical and physical data structures * maintenance  backup strategies </description>

      <title>Tuning Analysis Services Processing Performance</title>
      <description>You’ve got your Analysis Services cube created, and deployed in production. However, you notice that every night, the cube is taking longer and longer to process, and users are starting to complain about their data not being ready when they arrive in the morning. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or want to avoid being in it in the first place, come to this session. We’ll cover how to benchmark processing performance, track down bottlenecks, and how to tune things to get the best performance for processing your cube.</description>

      <title>Concurrency in PowerShell</title>
      <description>Moore's law is not dead; it lives on as CPU manufacturers add more and more CPU cores to the same chip real estate.  In this session, we will look at the ways in which you can leverage concurrent processing in your PowerShell code to dramatically increase the efficiency of your code.  Speed up those ETL processes, execute code on multiple servers at the same time, and complete your maintenance tasks much faster using the techniques you will learn.</description>

      <description>Reporting Services is a powerful tool that can make designing reports a snap...most of the time. But every once in a while you have to format a report very specifically, and that starts with your data query.  In this session, we'll think outside the group! Learn about how to use named sets, dummy members, and other MDX tricks to craft your queries in a way that allows you to conquer the trickiest report layouts.</description>

      <title>Execution Plans a Deep Dive</title>
      <description>It’s one thing to know to look for scans instead of seeks, but if you really want to know what’s going on in an execution plan, you need to dive deep. This session will cover reading execution plans from the basics, but goes way beyond the basics to cover as much of the information available within an execution plan as you might possibly ever need. We’ll go into how to understand how to interpret parameter sniffing and spot when a join operation is not performing the way you would want. We’ll use the graphical plan and the XML behind to thoroughly explore execution plans. </description>

      <title>Using NULL the Right Way</title>
      <description>Over the years, I have seen NULL abused in many ways, often to the detriment of the application.  This session will help you gain a deeper appreciation for what seems, on the surface, to be a simple topic.  We will dig into how NULLs impact schema semantics, storage internals, and query performance.

      <title>Fundamentals of Physical Join Operations</title>
      <description>This is a wonderful session for those that don't yet grok the three types of joins available to the SQL Server engine or the scenarios for which each join type is optimal. All will be explained here with some very slick visual demonstrations of internal data flow as well as TSQL code samples.  We will also show how bad performance can get when suboptimal joins are used.</description>
