Data Warehouse design, data processing, tuning, data quality - leading projects for Banks, Airlines, Retailers, Brewers (dim_beer anyone?), Universities etc.  When not building data warehouses Douglas loves hiking in the Northwest.  

It becomes abundantly clear after project 1 that agility - prototyping, iterations and collaboration with SMEs / BAs is the only way to de-risk a data project.  Douglas works for WhereScape - a software company that builds agile tools for developing / managing data warehouses / vaults / hubs.  The design will change - when it meets the data, when it meets the users - it is expected, lets make it easier.</description>

      <title>Extended Events in SQL Server 2008 and 2012</title>
      <description>I will demonstrate practical examples of how to use Extended Events to figure out details of what SQL Server is doing when problems are occuring. You can dig deep into the internals of SQL Server with Extended Events since they track operations at a very low level. Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 but have not been used that much because of the learning curve. SQL Server 2012 has promoted Extended Events to a much more important level. The feature is now ready to replace Profiler as the primary tool to gather real time details of query execution. The majority of my presentation will be demoing real world problem solving.</description>

      <title>Rules, Rules, and Rules</title>
      <description>Computers are governed by the rules of physics: electrons, drive heads, and disk platters can only move so fast. Understanding how these rules operate and interact leads to insights into application performance. Understanding why something might perform a certain way makes it much easier to understand the tradeoffs of a specific design.

Database systems are built according to those rules: memory is faster than disk which is faster than the network. Database schemas and queries are built within the rules of database systems. You will hit the limitations of these rules. If you know what the rules are and why they are in place, you'll know when it's time to break them... and how to succeed.</description>

      <title>AlwaysOn – Way to get your 9’s?</title>
      <description>We are always being told 9’s, 9’s  and more 9’s, but when implementation time comes to take action, technology / budget limitations get in the way, especially in the High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) technology space.  Clustering and Mirroring are great and meet many of our needs, but there are some things we have wished for, such as a mirror database that is usable. AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both Mirroring and Multi-Node Multi-Subnet Clustering (True Geo-Clustering Support!!!).  AlwaysOn also allows the replica database to be used in a Read-Only capacity, so we can use it for reporting purposes. (Imagine that!)  Join us in providing a warm welcome to this new functionality with extensive demos.</description>

Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.</description>

      <title>Avoid Errors on Errors</title>
      <description>Did you know that when SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action or control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome. This is a very common workplace faux pas and a Microsoft Certification topic for Dev and Admins. We will use lessons from SQL Programming Joes 2 Pros Vol4.</description>

      <title>Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer</title>
      <description>The SQL Server Query Optimizer is a cost-based optimizer: it analyzes a number of candidate execution plans for a given query, estimates the cost of each of these plans, and selects the plan with the lowest cost. In this session I will go into the internals of the Query Optimizer and will show you the steps that it performs in the background covering everything from the time a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated. Why query optimization is an inherently complex problem and why challenges in some of its most fundamental areas are still being addressed today will be covered as well.

      <title>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

      <title>Columnstore Indexes and Data Warehouses</title>
      <description>Columnstore indexes are one of the most exciting new features available in the next release of SQL Server 2012. Combined with new query processing algorithms, columnstore indexes are designed to improve the performance of data warehouses queries by several orders of magnitude providing more business value by allowing users to interactively explore the data. This session explains how columnstore indexes improve the performance of data warehouse queries—focusing on the query processing and optimization aspect of the technology—and identifies limitations of the current product release.</description>

      <title>Up Your Game With OUTPUT</title>
      <description>There are some classic database programming tasks that rely on answering the question "What did I just change?" Prior to SQL Server 2005, we had to use functions like SCOPE_IDENTITY() and some extra tricks for handling multiple rows. Some people even had to resort to triggers. Yikes!! This session focuses on the practical use cases for the T-SQL OUTPUT clause. More importantly, you will find out how you can ditch the tricks of the past for a simpler solution that will help keep you sane.</description>

      <title>Shiny New T-SQL for SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>There has been a lot of fanfare for some of the new features of SQL Server 2012. (AlwaysOn and T-SQL Windowing, I’m looking at you.) But there are a few other shiny little gems hidden between the replicas and frame clauses. The good folks at Microsoft have given T-SQL a few new features and functions, and it’s time to dig in and take a look at what presents they’ve brought us. T-SQL enhancements for 2012, including Result Sets, paging support, metadata discovery, new scalar functions, and the THROW clause for error handling are demonstrated in this session.

      <title>A Journey through New Features of SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 promises to be another milestone in improved performance, security, self-service BI, and migration to the cloud.  Among the enhancements in SQL Server 2012 are 14 new functions in T-SQL as well as SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and the new talk of the town: "AlwaysOn!"  Additional topics within the presentation will cover different viewpoints of DBAs, Developers, and IT Managers, both before and after the decision to upgrade to SQL Server 2012 and required planning steps.</description>

      <title>Understanding SQL Server XML Features </title>
      <description>The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server. </description>

      <title>Data Warehouse Best Practices</title>
      <description>This session will describe the best practises for designing a data warehouse to get the most out of SQL Server.  Doug has worked in data warehousing for 12 years and will blend experience, with best practises and recommendations from Microsoft's Fast Track program.  Each version of SQL Server introduces new features specifically for data warehousing - by applying the correct technique, feature, hint, modelling approach and layout the data warehouse will be faster and more scalable.</description>

      <title>The Performance Impact of Database Design</title>
      <description>Time-travel stories all have one common plot element - some action done in the past has big impact on the future. Sometimes you get lucky… Hoverboards! Sometimes, not so much... Morlocks! The same holds true in your database. Design decisions have a huge impact on how you’re going to get data into and out of your database. This session illustrates the performance impact of common database design issues and proposes design alternatives that will help your database avoid an H.G. Wellsian future.

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics. </description>
