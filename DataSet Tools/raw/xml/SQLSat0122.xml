      <title>SQL Server Internals  Architecture</title>
      <description>Let’s face it. You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works. Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes. But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture. This session will answer questions like: - What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems? - What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server? - How are queries handled behind the scenes? - What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers? - ...and much more.</description>

      <title>Why Data Warehousing Projects Fail</title>
      <description>Is your organization planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution? Data warehousing projects, like many large IT projects, have high failure rates. While the exact rate of failure for data warehousing projects is difficult to pin down, the causes of these failures fall into a small number of categories. It is obviously possible to successfully complete a data warehousing project and deliver value to the business. Craig Utley has seen Microsoft BI solutions in various states of completeness at over 30 companies worldwide and has seen some awesome successes and some spectacular failures. This session addresses the reasons data warehousing projects fail and how you can succeed in overcoming these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Private Clouds with SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>The recent growth of cloud computing has companies evaluating when  how, not if, they will move their data offsite. Despite the benefits that the cloud, many DBAs are leery of jumping into the cloud, fearful that their sensitive data will become vulnerable. The goal of this session is to provide you a blueprint to design  build your own SQL Server cloud, where you can control the server availability  performance reliability, yet still take advantage of the resource elasticity and hardware flexibility of the cloud. In this session, I will demonstrate how to use features like always on, resource governor, policy based management  PowerShell scripts to automate your servers behavior to achieve the benefits of the cloud without the risks</description>

      <title>Bridging the Chasm: BI Theory vs. Practice </title>
      <description>A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we will gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.</description>

      <title>What Sequence objects are (and are not)</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 adds a new object to our arsenal called a sequence that can will give us the capability to implement automatically incrementing values. However, it cannot replace a lot of functionality that we have used a numbers table and windowing functions for (though they can be complimentary to one another). In this session I will demonstrate the uses and performance characteristics of sequences, including how they compliment the use of number tables and windowing functions to create surrogate key and sorting values, and more.

      <title>Throwing T-SQL 2012 Enhancements Against the Wall</title>
      <description>Just like your grandma tested spaghetti to tell if it was done, we'll be throwing several of the new T-SQL enhancements against the wall to see what's good and what falls off. We'll silence the lion's RaiseRror by throwing some meaty exceptions. We'll bring together the old lovers "Coalesce" and "+" for one last jaunt before they are banished by the Concat function. We'll even open the window on some of the new aggregate and analytical functions as well as some other t-sql enhancements introduced in SQL 2012. </description>

      <title>Understanding Parameter sniffing and making it wor</title>
      <description>Parameter Sniffing is usually thought of as the bad guy, in association with a performance problem in your database. Contrary to the popular belief, Parameter Sniffing is usually the good guy, continuously working under the hood to help your database applications run faster. However, it can sometimes go wrong, causing severe performance degradation of your queries. 
In this session we will discuss the workings of Parameter Sniffing and demonstrate how it helps improve the performance of your database applications. We will also explore how Parameter Sniffing can go wrong and its impact. Several ways to fix bad Parameter Sniffing will be demonstrated to help make an appropriate choice for your scenario.

      <title>What Counts For a DBA</title>
      <description>The world of a DBA can be daunting for a person, either as a new or old, because not only do they need to keep up with new and emerging technologies, but also with the code and designs of their coworkers.  In this highly participation driven session, we will employ a random topic chooser to pick several of these traits for discussion as a group.  Possible topics include past blog topics such as Logic, Curiosity, Failure, Humility, Skill and Passion, as well as any other topics that might be added for that day. So come prepared to participate and voice your opinion about what counts for a DBA.

      <title>Partitioning for Perf  Management of Large Tables</title>
      <description>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Sharding with SQL Azure Federations</title>
      <description>Putting big data in the cloud is not without its difficulties and the Microsoft Azure teams have been consistently upping the resource limits that you are able to utilize within a given instance. Those of us with larger capacity instances still have to hedge our bets when looking at moving to the cloud. That is until the recent release of SQL Azure Federations, which offers a native SQL Azure based option to possible unlimited scalability. In this session, we will break down the basics of sharding within SQL Azure Federations, explain what needs to be taken into consideration in terms of database design, and put you on the right path to a successful Federation based deployment. </description>

      <description>With an ever increasing workload, security is often hoisted upon the DBA. So where do you start? Sometimes it's better to start off by understanding what an attacker could do to you in order to get a clearer picture of what you need to do to prevent it. In this session, we will delve into the key features of the SQL Server and explain what the various attack vectors are, what an attack can do with them,  and what you can do about them. We'll also look at important features such as SQL Audit that, while not helping to prevent, can definitely help you in definitely help in figuring out what is going on. It'll be AWESOME!</description>

In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up.  Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, hiding and obfuscating data and code, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem.  And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!</description>

      <title>Windowing Functions in SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 brings with it nearly full ANSI compliance with the windowing functions. Come to this code filled session to learn about all of the windowing functions in SQL Server 2012: Ranking functions, changes for windowing in the Aggregate functions, and the new Analytic and Sequence functions. We’ll examine how this latest implementation of the windowing functions allows us to perform running and sliding aggregations; retrieve data from adjacent rows in the partition, and much more – all without self-joins back to the source table.</description>

      <title>Transitioning from SQL Trace to Extended Events</title>
      <description>Extended Events were introduced with SQL Server 2008, but without a UI, which meant using T-SQL to create and manage them and using XPath and XQuery to parse the output.  Microsoft has added an Extended Events UI in SQL Server 2012 and also added additional events.  With the announcement that SQL Trace/Profiler is being deprecated now is the time to begin learning Extended Events.  This session will show you how to take existing Traces and convert them to Extended Event Sessions.</description>
