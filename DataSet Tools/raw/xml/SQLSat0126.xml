      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</title>
      <description>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</description>

      <title>SQL Azure Scalability with Federations</title>
      <description>With more and more companies moving to a cloud solution, the necessity to easily and efficiently scale their database solution is critical. This session will discuss how to scale SQL Azure using SQL Azure Federations, a recent addition to SQL Azure that provides the ability to build scalable, elastic, and multi-tenant solutions in SQL Azure. SQL Azzure Federations bring the sharding pattern into SQL Azure as a first class citizen as a way to achieve greater scalability and performance from the database tier of your application through horizontal partitioning at the database level. This session will look at Federations from a real-world point of view, by applying Federations to a real-life database. We will also look at performance benefits.</description>

      <title>PWNED! Security, SQL Server, and You!</title>
      <description>With an ever increasing workload, security is often hoisted upon the DBA. So where do you start? Sometimes it's better to start off by understanding what an attacker could do to you in order to get a clearer picture of what you need to do to prevent it. In this session, we will delve into the key features of the SQL Server and explain what the various attack vectors are, what an attack can do with them,  and what you can do about them. We'll also look at important features such as SQL Audit that, while not helping to prevent, can definitely help you in definitely help in figuring out what is going on. It'll be AWESOME!</description>

      <title>Parameter sniffing - make it work for you !</title>
      <description>Parameter Sniffing is usually thought of as the bad guy, in association with a performance problem in your database. Contrary to the popular belief, Parameter Sniffing is usually the good guy, continuously working under the hood to help your database applications run faster. However, it can sometimes go wrong, causing severe performance degradation of your queries. 
In this session we will discuss the workings of Parameter Sniffing and demonstrate how it helps improve the performance of your database applications. We will also explore how Parameter Sniffing can go wrong and its impact. Several ways to fix bad Parameter Sniffing will be demonstrated to help make an appropriate choice for your scenario.

      <title>Manage SQL Server 2012 on Server Core w/PowerShell</title>
      <description>Windows Server 2008 introduced Server Core, the operating system without the Graphical User Interface. SQL Server 2012 is the first version of SQL Server to support Server Core. To gain the maximum efficiency from your servers you want to make use of Server Core and with PowerShell you can effectively manage SQL Server in that environment. This session will demonstrate how to manage SQL Server 2012 on Windows Server Core and provide scripts to help you perform the common tasks you need to perform on that platform.</description>

      <title>Powershell and Perfmon...Come on!</title>
      <description>Many DBA's and sysadmins are starting to use PowerShell to automate routine/daily tasks.  A task that can be time consuming to setup on each server is performance monitoring with Perfmon.  A great way to automate that task is to use PowerShell.  So, let's take a venture into PowerShell land and see how to write our very first script.  Along the way we will capture performance counters and then export them to a blg formatted file for viewing.</description>

      <title>TempDB Performance Troubleshooting and Optimizing</title>
      <description>Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. After this session, you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.</description>

      <description>What exactly does it mean to parallelize a query? Why would the optimizer do this and what are the benefits and what are the drawbacks?? Is it always faster? Can it cause problems? Are there reasons we might NOT want parallelization? What can prevent it's use by the engine? These are some of the topics we will cover as we dig into this facet of the SQL Server relational engine.</description>

      <title>Seven SQL Agent Jobs You Should be Running</title>
      <description>See those things around your ankles? You hope they're your socks because no DBA wants to be caught with their pants down.

Whether you're an accidental DBA, a DBA who has just inherited a bunch of servers, or someone who works in a shop that won't buy monitoring tools, this session will help you get basic monitoring in place to make sure you know what's going on in your environment.

You'll learn how to implement seven simple scripts that perk their ears up and start barking like a dog after a stranger walks in the house. They are the canary in your coal mine. You'll know when backups fail, when they run longer than usual, when data files are getting full, when transaction logs have excessive VLFs, and more.</description>

      <title>Optimizing SQL Server I/O with Solid State Drives</title>
      <description>Optimal configuration and maintenance of the I/O subsystem is critical and can ultimately be responsible for higher response times of your applications. The HDDs are by design about 1 million times slower than the memory or CPU. In this session we analyze the different options that exist for durable storage, what are their pros and cons . Solid state drives are a viable option and we are going under the covers to see how you can best use them as an alternative to a large and expensive SAN in your infrastructure</description>

      <title>SSIS: The DBA Multiplier</title>
      <description>er wanted to create clones of yourself to get all your work done faster? I will demonstrate how SSIS can help you perform your DBA tasks as if there were more than one of you. You will leave the session knowing how to use SSIS to automate tasks such as performance monitoring above (and below) the normal health checks and transporting databases from one environment to another. You will also learn how SSIS can be used in assisted HA and DR failover strategies as well as backup solutions that go beyond the simple BACKUP statement. We’re going to take SSIS and make it a standard tool for your administrative tasks!

      <title>The Script Task, powerhouse of SSIS</title>
      <description>Everyday more DBAs and SQL developers are given responsibility for ETL development. They have a strong SQL background with little or no .Net language programming experience. As they progress with SSIS, they can come up against perceived limitations in the capabilities of SSIS using only the built-in tasks. What they may not realize is the extensibility available to SSIS via the Script Task. This presentation will provide them with the tools they need to move beyond that perceived limitation. Updated for SSIS 2012.</description>

      <title>A Complete BI Solution in About an Hour! </title>
      <description>In this presentation Aaron will cover how to collect data from multiple SQL Servers using SQL Server 2008 Integration Services (SSIS). Then he will use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to report detail on that data. After that he will use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to create a KPI. Finally he’ll present that KPI on a dashboard via a web page. The goal of this presentation is to show how seamless the Microsoft Business Intelligence products are. If you’ve only used a few of these products, you’ll appreciate seeing them together all at once. Code will be provided.</description>

      <description>Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.</description>

      <title>Understanding SSIS Performance</title>
      <description>Many casual users of SSIS (including database professionals using the SSMS Import/Export Wizard) don't necessarily understand the inner workings of SSIS and what factors impact performance.  During this session, we'll look at different aspects of SSIS and discuss their impact on package performance.  We'll take a deep dive into the Data Flow component, looking at how SSIS manages data as it moves from sources, through transformations, and then to destinations.  Finally, we'll talk about several of the top performance killers casual SSIS users experience and discuss strategies for overcoming these common issues.</description>
