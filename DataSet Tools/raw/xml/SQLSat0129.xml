      <title>Getting Started with MDX</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.</description>

      <title>Deadlocks and what to do about them</title>
      <description>Confusion persists around what a deadlock is, why they occur, and how to prevent them. This session will give you a good overview of how deadlocks occur and what you can do about them. Most importantly, we'll go over the ways you can identify when a deadlock occurred and which processes were involved. We'll do all this using the standard SQL Server tools so you can put it to work on your systems immediately.</description>

      <title>Replication- A fresh look  peek behind the scenes</title>
      <description>SQL Server Replication is an often overlooked solution to a common problem - shared data. It is passed by as a solution of choice due to inaccurate misconceptions about complexity, performance, scalability and finally "fear" of the unknown. In this session we will take a fresh look at replication and how it can be used to benefit your organization. We will also take a look at what replication is doing behind the scenes, deal with some of the common misconceptions, and discuss solutions to some of the common problems that will allow DBA's to reconsider this SQL Server technology as a "center stage" solution. </description>

      <title>What to Look for in Execution Plans</title>
      <description>You've heard often enough that you need to look at execution plans to understand what's going on with a query. But what are you supposed to look at? This session answers that question, providing a step-by-step set of considerations for evaluating your execution plans. We'll look at the aspects of an execution plan that should be immediately checked, why they should be checked, and provide some guidance for what to do about what you find. You'll be able to apply this information to your SQL Server 2012 systems as well as older versions of SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness</title>
      <description>SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

      <title>Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!</title>
      <description>SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

      <title>Understanding SQL Server XML Features </title>
      <description>The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server. </description>
