      <title>SQL Server Internals:  It's What's for Dinner!</title>
      <description>Ever wondered what happens under the hood when you query your SQL Server database? Well, it’s somewhat like asking for a special meal for dinner. During this session, I will use a cooking analogy to describe the life cycle of a query and the journey it takes through SQL Server’s working parts. By comparing the concepts of SQL Internals to a familiar idea, you will have a clear understanding of the underlying processes involved in returning data from a SELECT query. Once we’ve established a frame of reference for a simple read operation, we’ll look at an UPDATE statement and consider the additional factors associated with a write operation.  By session's end you should have a clear overview of what happens when a query hits your server.</description>

      <title>Deep Dive into Indexes (Part 1)</title>
      <description>No system ever performs well even on the most powerful hardware unless the database is efficiently indexed. But what does "efficient indexing" mean? Database Professionals impress customers by use of magic buzzwords such as “Indexing strategies” and “Performance tuning” and happily contribute to the myth about complexity of the subject. But with all complexity involved it’s not Rocket Science – the key point is to understand how SQL Server works with indexes and look at them from SQL Server standpoint.  This session dives into the internals of SQL Server and covers various topics such as index physical structure, how and when indexes are used, how to design efficient indexing strategy and perform the index tuning of the system.</description>

      <description>Focus: FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search In SQL 2012
It’s like having the biggest junk drawer EVER.  That’s often what our “Document Repositories” become.  You know you have that golden nugget of information that you’re searching for, and it’s in there somewhere, but you can’t find it. This session explores a new feature of SQL 2012 called Statistical Semantic Search. It's like having a closet organizer on staff at all times.  While full-text search lets you query the words in a document, semantic search lets you query the meaning of the document. New scenarios we will look into will include automatic tag extraction, related content discovery, and hierarchical navigation across similar content.</description>

      <title>Taking the Scary out of Monster Reports</title>
      <description>So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report.  It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities.  Did I mention they want it pretty as well?  In this session we will discuss how to use SQL Reporting Services 2008 R2 to bring it all together while avoiding the pit falls and mistakes.  The demonstration will show how to build a multi-page, dashboard style report to manage your report server showing a multitude of grids and charts.  We will discuss the challenges with data reuse and formatting while exploring techniques for getting them to work.  To get the most out of this session, you should be able to build a report in SSRS.

      <title>Indexing your Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Hello, My Name Is DAX</title>
      <description>For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by jusst connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without develo9pment access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.</description>

Come and learn how the new SQL 2012 feature, ColumnStore Indexes, can parallelize your Data Warehouse aggregations in the same way. I will be doing a deep dive into the inner workings of ColumnStore indexes.If you are a production DBA who needs to find out about some of the additional hot features that have been included with CSI's, like batch mode processing and data segments or if you are a BI developer who needs to find out how CSI's can increase the performance of your aggregations and star-joins by up to 40 times, then this session is for you.</description>

      <description>With SQL Server 2012 it has never been easier to empower your data stewards and give them greater control over the data management process. Dive in as we integrate Master Data Services and Data Quality Services into a data warehouse. We will explore how Master Data Services and the new plugins available in 2012 can facilitate the management of your organization’s master data. A look at Data Quality Services will highlight how it can be leveraged to provide value to the data management process through its cleansing and matching capabilities. Finally, we evaluate the options available to integrate back into the data warehouse.</description>

Have you moved to SQL Server from MS Access, or Excel, or other non-relational database products?  This session will help explain the basics of set theory and relational theory using actual Lego blocks.  We will illustrate terms and concepts such as joins, unions, and set-based operations, and how you can translate them into actual SQL.  If you're an absolute beginner to SQL, or feel overwhelmed by the baggage of computer data models, or would just like to play with Legos, you'll both enjoy and learn something during this session.</description>

      <description>In this session, you will learn valuable techniques on how to performance tune your SSIS packages.  As many of you know, creating ETL to carry out a specific task is one thing, but optimizing that ETL to run in an acceptable amount of time is a whole different animal.  You will learn about methods and properties that aren’t really mentioned in your introductory or even mid-level SSIS courses, as well as some unconventional tricks that I’ve picked up along the way.  To get the most out of this session, you will need to have previous knowledge and experience with SQL Server Integration Services (Not an intro session).</description>

      <title>Handling Advanced Data Warehouse Scenarios in SSIS</title>
      <description>So you’ve used SSIS to populate a simple star schema data mart, and everybody’s happy. But now you have new requirements that require more advanced data warehouse approaches, like late arriving dimensions, bridge tables, parent child dimensions, and Type 3 or Type 6 slowly changing dimensions (SCD). How do you handle those in a scalable, efficient way in SSIS? This session will present some common patterns for handling these scenarios. You’ll learn when to use each advanced approach and the pros and cons associated with each pattern. You will learn how to implement these patterns in SSIS, and how to tune them for high performance.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Databases in a Virtual Environment</title>
      <description>When moving databases to a virtual environment the performance metrics DBAs typically use to troubleshoot performance issues such as O/S metrics, storage configurations, CPU allocation and more become unreliable. DBAs no longer have a clear, reliable view of the factors impacting database performance. Understanding the difference between the physical and virtual server environment adds a new dimension to the DBA tasks. This presentation describes the changes that DBAs need to make in their performance and monitoring practices.</description>
