      <title>SharePoint Primer for .NET Developers</title>
      <description>This session will cover an introduction of the SharePoint architecture, details on the more common customization and extensibility areas for developers including application pages, JavaScript, event receivers, workflows, web parts, and field types. We will also cover different options for developing composite solutions leveraging SharePoint data and hosting of your applications in SharePoint. Due to the amount of content, this session is mostly at the architectural level. There will be some demos, but there will not be a lot of depth in one particular area. To gain the most value out of this session it is suggested that you be at least an intermediate level web developer and some experience using SharePoint basic functions as an end user.</description>

      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</title>
      <description>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</description>

      <title>Beyond Plateaux: Optimize SSAS with Best Practices</title>
      <description>Whether we inherit our Analysis Services environments from predecessors or create them - learning as we go - ourselves, we often conclude that performance (processing and / or querying) and functionality can be enhanced. In this session, Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews ways to launch new capabilities, and to propel performance beyond its current plateau, using design best practices to better meet consumer performance and functional needs. This is the initial session of a set of detailed Best Practices presentations.</description>

      <title>Data Quality Made Simple</title>
      <description>Imagine your business with fewer integration projects, coming in on time and under budget.  Let us further imagine your business making great decisions based on the right data at the right time.  In this session we will explore the concepts of data quality, as well as some of the tools and initiatives which relate to scoring your data and correcting your business processes for data input.  This is NOT a presentation on Data Quality Services, although we will look at how this new tool might fit within your data quality initiatives.  Return to the office informed and invigorated with the knowledge that bad data can be overcome!  </description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.

      <description>FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search In SQL 2012
It’s like having the biggest junk drawer EVER.  That’s often what our “Document Repositories” become.  You know you have that golden nugget of information that you’re searching for, and it’s in there somewhere, but you can’t find it. This session explores a new feature of SQL 2012 called Statistical Semantic Search. It's like having a closet organizer on staff at all times.  While full-text search lets you query the words in a document, semantic search lets you query the meaning of the document. New scenarios we will look into will include automatic tag extraction, related content discovery, and hierarchical navigation across similar content.

      <title>Execution Plan Beyond Basics</title>
      <description>So you been using Execution Plans for a little while and want to know more. This session will look deeper into Nested, Merge and Hash Joins. What to look for in the memory grants will be discussed. Using MAXDOP and Cost Threshold will be demostrated to understand parallel plans. Demostrations will show Aggregate Iterators and how to find out if the optimizer is smarter than us. 2012 enhancements to execution plans will be shown throughout the demos</description>

      <title>Do More With Less: Consolidate and Virtualize</title>
      <description>In today's economic times, we are being asked to do more with less. Less budget, less hardware and yet our data needs keep growing! So how do we keep our database infrastructure humming along given these restrictions? In this session we will talk about different options of consolidation including: database-level consolidation, instance-level consolidation, and virtualization. Additionally we will also talk about some of the tools and methods you can use today to help you consolidate your SQL Server environment and do more with less!</description>

      <title>The Dirty Business of Auditing</title>
      <description>Auditing is often a dirty word among DBAs because it equates to more work with little perceived business value. However, auditing is a necessary evil for most businesses and it usually falls to the DBA to ensure SQL Server is properly audited. In this session we'll look at what the operating system and SQL Server provide for us in order to meet the requirements of internal and external auditors, regulatory legislation, and even overbearing system owners who want to know everything about what's going on in their application. We'll consider what tools to use to quickly implement the properly level of auditing to meet the need.</description>

      <title>SSIS 2012: Project Deployment Model End To End</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 makes major improvements to SSIS in a number of areas: development experience, troubleshooting, deployment and management. Many of these improvements are based on the new server side catalog (SSISDB) and are available only when you use the new Project Deployment Model. In this session, you will learn how to create projects using the new deployment model, deploy, track, execute and manage SSIS packages. We will also explore some of the improvements in SQL Server Data Tools -formerly known as BIDS-, and the server side user experience using SSMS. Whether you are new to SSIS or planning to upgrade your skills to the new version, you will find the information given in this session valuable.

      <title>Replication Magic: Initializing From Backups</title>
      <description>If you work with very large databases (VLDBs) that must be replicated, you should be using initialization from backup. There are a some misconceptions the have caused DBAs to assume that they could not use initialization from backup. In this session I will explore those misconceptions and prove that they are incorrect.

Demos will include initializing a subscriber from a transaction log backup and performing a partial restore of a database and initializing the subscriber from the partial backup.</description>

We’ll get into the mindset of an attacker, looking at the methods and techniques attackers use to go after SQL Server. Once we understanding the threats, we’ll then examine defensive techniques to secure and protect our SQL Servers, using both new and creative methods, as well as the tried and true.</description>

      <title>Lego Sets: Relational Building Blocks</title>
      <description>Do your eyes glaze over at the mention of tuples, domains, or even basic SQL terms?  Have you moved to SQL Server from MS Access, or Excel, or other non-relational database products?  This session will help explain the basics of set theory and relational theory using actual Lego blocks.  We will illustrate terms and concepts such as joins, unions, and set-based operations, and how you can translate them into actual SQL.  If you're an absolute beginner to SQL, or feel overwhelmed by the baggage of computer data models, or would just like to play with Legos, you'll both enjoy and learn something during this session.</description>
