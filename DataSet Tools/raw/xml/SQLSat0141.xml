      <title>Deep Dive into Indexes (Part 2)</title>
      <description>No system ever performs well even on the most powerful hardware unless the database is efficiently indexed. But what does "efficient indexing" mean? Database Professionals impress customers by use of magic buzzwords such as “Indexing strategies” and “Performance tuning” and happily contribute to the myth about complexity of the subject. But with all complexity involved it’s not Rocket Science – the key point is to understand how SQL Server works with indexes and look at them from SQL Server standpoint.  
This session dives into the internals of SQL Server and covers various topics such as index physical structure, how and when indexes are used, how to design efficient indexing strategy and perform the index tuning of the system.</description>

      <title>Know Backups and Know Recovery</title>
      <description>You say you have a backup strategy, but what is your recovery strategy? 

In this session Tim will demonstrate several methods for performing much-needed backups and how to recover those backups to include FULL, DIFFERENTIAL, FILE GROUP, and TRANSACTION LOG.  He will also demo performing a peace meal restore as well as backing up and restoring the tail end of the log after the data file becomes corrupt.
 
Tim will discuss industry best practices for backing up and recovering your data.  The goal of this session is to educate you on the various backup strategies so you can decide which is best for your organization, demonstrate how to recover your databases, and to create the desire for you to go back and validate your current strategies</description>

      <description>TEMPDB is just for temporary data right? It is installed by default and gets recreated each time SQL is restarted so what does it matter right? WRONG TEMPDB is a critical part of your SQL Server instance and needs special attention. In this session Tim Radney will give you insight into what uses TEMPDB, why TEMPDB is important, what are the best practices for configuring TEMPDB, what makes TEMPDB so unique, and how to determine if your TEMPDB has a contention issue. Tim will demo creating contention in TEMPDB and explain how to solve this dreadful issue. If you have systems where TEMPDB hasn't been touched since the install, you need to attend this session.</description>

      <description>The Reporting Services expression language can be a powerful tool for customizing report data and layout, but often times you will find it is lacking functionality that is easily available in .Net.  While this session is not designed to teach you .Net it will show you some commonly used .Net functions for Reporting Services.  We will also talk about the difference between custom code that is embedded in a report and external assemblies imported into Reporting Services.</description>

      <title>Looney Tuner?  No, there IS a method to my madness</title>
      <description>SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.</description>

      <title>Mining XML Query Plans</title>
      <description>Execution plans contain a lot of information that can guide you in your performance tuning process. Since SQL 2005 it is possible to retrieve the execution plans stored in the cache using DMVs and DMFs. However, as they are stored in XML format it can be cumbersome and difficult to extract the information you need. In this session, you will learn how the XML query plan is structured and how to use SQL Server’s built-in XQuery language to extract information. Examples include indexes that the optimizer indicates would increase performance if implemented and queries that use table scans or nested loop joins.</description>
