      <description>Today's executives and information workers want to use mobile devices to get at their business information, make critical decisions, and thrive. Let's help them get there with SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint. Tablets are common place now, and smart phones have been in place for years, but have we devoted enough attention to make effective use of the new form factors? Let's discuss how our design approach changes when we want to launch mission-critical dashboards and reports on smaller screen sizes using touch-screen technology. We'll look at iPad and other mobile devices, SSRS and SharePoint, BI Developer and Business User, with emphasis on data visualization best practices.</description>

      <description>A recent survey by Information Week found that data qality is the greatest barrier to BI adoption in enterprises.  MDS addresses this challenge with modelling, validation, alerting and security capabilities.  In this presentation, you will learn how to configure MDS to model your data to ensure correctness, update it with changes from your ERP, and alert users to data conditions that require attention.  You will get tips on best practices and on how to engage uses with an MDM project.  By learning this tool, and its new features in 2012, BI professionals will gain a valuable new skill that addresses the greatest risk to success for BI projects - data quality.</description>

      <title>Instant Scale, High Avail.  Performance for SQL</title>
      <description>Achieving scale-out quickly and easily for MS SQL Server environments can be extremely difficult, if not impossible.  Other areas that are difficult or costly to achieve for SQL Server environments include transparent caching of Read queries, as well as instrumentation and Analytics of all SQL queries in *real-time*.  In this session, you will learn how ScaleArc has developed SQL Server infrastructure software that achieves instant scale-out, caching, load balancing, firewall/filtering and higher availability…without any changes or modifications to existing applications or SQL Server databases.  For those interested in migrating to SQL Server 2012, we will also discuss how ScaleArc can assist and add-value in a 2012 migration.</description>

      <title>Managing and Auditing SQL Server Permissions</title>
      <description>When your boss asks you who has access to your databases, do you break out into a cold sweat? Or, instead, are you worried about those other people who might have 'sa' access to your server and might be causing trouble on your server? Either way, as DBAs we need to be able to audit our SQL Server security. This presentation will give you a general overview of the different types of roles that you can use to manage access, what they mean, and how we look at the security gremlins hiding under the covers of our databases. </description>

      <title>Stop Bad Data in its OLTP Tracks</title>
      <description>Incorrect, inaccurate and misleading data can get into a database in a variety of ways. It causes bugs, impacts customers and hurts business. This session will explain how DBAs and developers can proactively ensure the data coming into a transactional system is clean and correct. The topics covered will include table design, the pitfalls of NULL, “garbage in”, transactions, change management, and coding standards. 

The presentation will draw on the speaker's years of personal experience managing busy e-commerce databases supporting multi-million dollar businesses. The speaker will use real-life examples and demos to illustrate the many ways that OLTP data quality can be compromised.</description>

      <description>How do you find information that was saved misspelled, or when your search is misspelled? Fuzzy-string processing! And if your information is in a database, the best place to do that processing is in the database. But there are some performance lessons to learn along the way. This session graphically illustrates the Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm, and explains how it was optimized for T-SQL, using www.fuzzy-string.com and Confio Ignite.</description>

      <title>Advanced SQL Injection techniques</title>
      <description>SQL injection remains one of the most widely-used tactics used by hackers to exploit security vulnerabilities of databases in order to get at sensitive information or to gain further system access to wreak havoc with more attacks. Though the majority of SQL injections are fairly simple and familiar, the more advanced ones can evade detection by some conventional security measures. I will offer up an in-depth analysis of some sophisticated SQL injection hacks and attacks, and offer up some best practices on how to harden your applications and databases against them in order to keep business-critical information safe.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>Replication Basics</title>
      <description>Let's cover the basics of setting up and monitoring SQL server Replication.  I will focus on configuring transactional replication including options for the distributor, and where to run your log reader agents - but rest assured we will touch on merge and snapshot replication as well.

      <title>Seeking SQL Server Secrets</title>
      <description>Many experienced DBAs are aware that there are many undocumented commands and traceflags in SQL Server, and some DBAs may even keep track of all references to such options whenever they read about them in an article or blog posts, or hear about them at a conference.  In this session, I’ll not only tell you about some of my favorite undocumented features, I’ll also tell you some of my tricks for discovering more undocumented secrets.</description>

      <title>Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!</title>
      <description>SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

      <title>Exposing the Core: SQL 2012 on Server Core</title>
      <description>Everything that's old is new again, as Windows Server moves back to the terminal interface.  With SQL 2012, we can now run our SQL Servers on Server Core, a version of the Windows OS that is smaller and more secure.  This presentation will introduce you to Server Core, how to prepare it for a SQL installation(including using Powershell for management), and how to actually install SQL 2012 on to it.</description>

      <title>Fast-track to BI Analytics with SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 has made it easier to make the move to Business Intelligence and in this session Carlos Bossy will present three new features you can (and should) implement immediately.  The new Analytics functions in T-SQL, Columnstore indexes, and the Tabular model are powerful features that will give your users the ability to analyze data in a faster, more effective manner.  Each of these features was targeted at casual or beginning BI developers and DBAs who more familiar with traditional relational database models.  You will leave this session with a good understanding of the next steps to take to get on the fast-track to BI.</description>

      <title>Top Query Optimizer Topics for Better Performance</title>
      <description>This session will show you how a better understanding of how the Query Optimizer works can help you to improve the performance of your queries. I will show you the top 10 Query Optimizer topics that can give you the most benefit by focusing both on concepts and practical solutions. Several areas of the query processor will be covered, everything from troubleshooting query performance problems and identifying what information the Query Optimizer needs to do a better job to the extreme cases where, because of the its limitations, the Query Optimizer may not give you a good plan and you may need to take a different approach.</description>
