      <title>PowerShell 101</title>
      <description>If you haven't dug in to PowerShell at this point, you're missing out on some amazing, powerful, practical stuff that could save you time every day. PowerShell does have a learning curve at the outset, especially for those not already familiar with OO concepts or programming in a language like C#, so this introductory session will go through the very basics of PowerShell syntax. If that collection of pipes and hyphens and curly braces seems to be written in some incomprehensible foreign language, this session is for you. At the end of the session you should have a grasp of how and why a PowerShell script does what it does, and the confidence to dig in deeper and begin using POSH scripts in your own work.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Join</title>
      <description>A lot of database professionals today  do not have a Computer-Science Degree  so they never attended a  “Introduction to Databases” course. In this session we are trying to fix at least one thing and we’ll look in depth at the three types of join operations, visualize how their algorithms work in order to understand how query plans are computed, explain why these join operations have very different performance characteristics and why the optimizer chooses a specific  join operator to use in a query plan. Will demonstrate that empirical cost calculations are similar to what Query Optimizer actually outputs. Good understanding of join algorithms is vital in order to diagnose and remedy issues related to bad query plans.</description>

      <title>Design and Implement BI Like Edison! </title>
      <description>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor. In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.</description>

      <title>An Intro to Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>This session will introduce the new xVelocity Memory-Optimized Columnstore Index feature of SQL 2012. This presentation will describe what a column store index is, how this feature is used to store data by columns instead of by rows and compare the advantages and disadvantages between the two storage methods. Live demos will explore how to create columnstore indexes, when to create them, best practices for using them and typical data warehouse scenarios that can leverage the columnstore index to drastically speed up data warehouse queries, in many cases by a factor of 10 to 100, so you are equipped to start implementing this feature into your database environment.</description>

      <description>Normalizing a database - splitting apart tables into simpler, more focused tables - can yield concrete benefits, including manageability, scalability, and space savings.  The concept is a central tenet of a relational database system such as SQL Server, yet far too many database professionals are unfamiliar with it.  This session will present a practical primer on normalization: what it is, why it's beneficial, how to do it, and when not to do it.</description>

      <title>Getting to Know Index Operation Stats</title>
      <description>There's a lot that goes on under the covers of SQL Server with your indexes. But it's not as secretive as you might think. Most of this information is made available to you through DMVs. While this information is useful - you need a clear understanding of what is in the DMVs in order to understand what is going on. In this session we'll take a dive into sys.dm_index_operational_stats to find out what it does and what you can do with this information.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Data Model Prototyping With PowerPivot</title>
      <description>Data modeling is often an abstract exercise involving a lot of talk and diagrams, but little hands-on experimentation.  This may still be viable in the world of transactional systems where a lack of source data prevents the modeler from quickly creating a prototype system, however in the world of dimensional modeling where source data is abundant there’s no longer a reason to treat data modeling as an academic exercise.  This session will cover how to use PowerPivot for Excel to quickly create prototypes of different dimensional models to try out and discard as necessary.  The features of PowerPivot which allow quick import of data from a variety of data sources will also be demonstrated.  </description>

      <title>A Complete BI Solution in About an Hour!</title>
      <description>In this presentation Aaron will cover how to collect data from multiple SQL Servers using SQL Server 2008 Integration Services (SSIS). Then he will use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to report detail on that data. After that he will use SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to create a KPI. Finally he’ll present that KPI on a dashboard via a web page. The goal of this presentation is to show how seamless the Microsoft Business Intelligence products are. If you’ve only used a few of these products, you’ll appreciate seeing them together all at once. Code will be provided. </description>

      <title>The Creepy DBA, How to Stalk Your Users</title>
      <description>Do you know when your users are using the production login accounts from their workstations? Are you aware of changes being made to the development servers that may impact future deployments? Has the new Junior DBA start giving out access like candy? As DBAs, we are responsible for knowing and acting on all of this and much more. Fortunately, SQL Server provides a number of features that you can use to monitor and track user activity. In this session, we’ll look at these features and demonstrate how you can use them to the extent that your users find you creepy!</description>

      <description>In this session explore the use of the SQL Server spatial data types.  We will see an example of the geography spatial data type used to represent data in a round-earth coordinate system.  Then the geometry spatial data type which represents data in a flat coordinate system will be demonstrated.  Both spatial types are CLR data types and provide a powerful way for businesses; such as; retailers to identify where their shoppers are concentrated, or for call centers to visualize the effect of top performers on others.</description>

      <title>Documenting Your Integrated Microsoft BI Solution</title>
      <description>Having implemented BI solutions for years, I have found documentation to be a task too often resisted until late in the project, when it is hastily and incompletely prepared in remaining hours. Because the integrated Microsoft BI solution comprises multiple application layers, it is challenging to generate documentation about the whole solution in a single, unified document. In this presentation I will share approaches I’ve come to use in assembling documentation that “covers all the bases.”</description>

      <description>We've all heard these words - but what do they all mean? No - this isn't about getting boats up a hill, small building bricks, or an uncommon hairstyle. In this session we'll identify the most common locks and discuss how to leverage and avoid their use. We'll discuss how these locks can turn into blocks and discuss several techniques that can be employed to insure increase data availability and improve performance. Wrapping up the trio, we'll discuss what deadlocks are and what they are not as we discuss strategies for both detection and remediation of this often misunderstood concept. </description>

      <title>Resolving Cardinality Estimate Issues </title>
      <description>When the query optimizer inaccurately predicts the number of rows for query execution plan iterators, performance can suffer due the generation and use of a suboptimal plan.

      <title>A Powershell Driven Life</title>
      <description>Why am I here?  This is a question you might ask yourself each day at work.  Perhaps its mundane tasks, reactive troubleshooting, or just filling out TPS reports on a Friday afternoon.  This session is going to attack the mundane and show you some of the things Powershell can bring to the table for working with SQL Server.  From performance monitoring to writing tests, it promises to be entirely scripts and demos compiled from real work on a large OLTP SQL environment .  The theoretical will be ignored as well as any common decency towards mass produced beer.       

No SSIS or Powerpoint will be harmed during this presentation.  </description>

      <title>Posh Eye for the BI Guy</title>
      <description>In this session we will explore the many ways that PowerShell can help
with all aspects of the software development process.
Including Development, Deployment, and Administration. Specific
products in the stack covered will be SQL Server Reporting Services
(SSRS), SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Analysis
Services (SSAS). We will spend time going over some basic project
structure and configuration management best practices as well. Some
previous minor exposure to PowerShell or .Net programming is assumed.</description>

      <title>Merge Replication for Offline Data Mobility</title>
      <description>How many times have you been sitting in a meeting and you hear, “We want all our users to have access to the data, 24/7. That includes when they are offline and on a client location”. At this point you may start letting out a large sigh because you are thinking, “How could the user get to the data if there is no connection?” This isn’t as hard as you may think and this session will show how to use SQL Servers Merge Replication in order to accomplish the task. Merge replication offers a scalable option for data mobility. This session will go over how Merge Replication can be used to replicate data to users that spend many hours offline.

      <title>SSRS: Reporting on Reports</title>
      <description>Business Intelligence gets a lot of press these days, but do you often wonder to yourself as you are writing a report, ‘Who is going to use this’? Learn about the rich information that SSRS is already capturing for you about your reports: who is running them and how often, how long do they take to execute, how much time is spent in data retrieval vs rendering, which parameters were passed in, and more…

      <title>Recovering from Corruption</title>
      <description>Corruption cannot always be avoided. You can take steps to ensure early detection, and you can prepare for the eventuality of it occurring, but it's not possible to completely prevent it. Early detection is your best protection against data lost due to corruption.

In this session, we will discuss the protections within SQL Server to help identify corruption and to help recover from it. We will look at the different types of corruption that could hit your database and the best way to deal with each type. Includes live demos recovering from different types of corrupt databases.</description>
