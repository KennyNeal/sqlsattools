      <title>MicroORMs:Data Access That Won't Make Your DBA Cry</title>
      <description>Modern ORMs like NHibernate and Entity Framework are powerful, flexible tools that are the right choice for many projects. But they feel like overkill for that little internal app with three tables and one screen. And even after a ton of tuning, the SQL they produce for that massive screen in your mission-critical enterprise app can be abysmal. It turns out that both of these problems might have the same answer: a Micro ORM. These lightweight tools leverage the power of dynamic typing and other advanced .NET framework features to give you a simple way to get your data that's also easy to optimize. Brian will give an overview of the various tools available, and dive deep into PetaPoco to show you how powerful these little frameworks can be.</description>

      <description>Youâ€™re a good SQL professional â€“ you attend conferences and webinars, you read articles and books, and you know your way around SQL Server. But sometimes â€“ just SOMEtimes â€“ some piece of T-SQL slips by you unnoticed, or falls out of memory. Most of us are working with at least two or three out of the last five versions of SQL Server, so who can blame us for missing a feature or two? Come and revisit old favorites, and brush up on new T-SQL features and enhancements. In this session you will see SELECT turned inside-out. Youâ€™ll get really, really excited about OVER and PARTITION BY. Youâ€™ll learn that Common Table Expressions are, in fact, very cool. This session is chock full of code examples, including before-and-after demos and how-tos.</description>

      <title>Adventures in Project Management</title>
      <description>Projects that run long, run over budget, or flat out fail always get management's attention, and not good attention.  This session will cover the project management process and demonstrate how it can help deliver higher quality results on time and on budget.  

Case studies and real world examples will arm managers and team leads with tools including communication management plans, requirements documentation, stakeholder management plans, and change management.  These tools will help mitigate and manage common project pitfalls like status update meetings, gold plating, and scope creep.

At the end of the session attendees will be armed with the knowledge necessary to streamline projects and how to deliver a top quality work product.

      <title>Data Visualizations: From Zero to Hero</title>
      <description>I will discuss one of the easiest ways to make our bosses happy: using data to answer their most difficult questions.  Our challenge is to take massive amounts of data and transform it into meaningful visualizations for the business teams that that IT department services. The most difficult problem often lies at the intersection of millions of lines of data and the teamâ€™s ability to sort through pages upon pages of Excel or printed reports.  I will discuss simple methods of transforming that data from Excel, SQL Server, Oracle, and even flat text files into visualizations which answer some of the biggest questions in a matter of seconds; SSRS or BI development experience is not required.  </description>

      <title>Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0</title>
      <description>The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell.  Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but weâ€™re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell.  This session will take you from nothing  and explain what powershell is all about.  Iâ€™m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, youâ€™ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else.  So in this session Iâ€™m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.</description>

      <description>In recent years, the WCF team at Microsoft has released multiple REST services, while the ASP.NET team has helped developers build basic APIs by allowing JSON to be returned from MVC controllers. ASP.NET Web API is a joint effort by both teams to provide a single RESTful API framework.  This session will cover the basics of how to use ASP.NET Web API to build simple HTTP services.  We will start with a new MVC 4 project and build a functional API that can be consumed by numerous clients in order to query and manipulate data from the host.</description>

      <title>Unit Testing - Solving some Tough Issues</title>
      <description>Unit Tests are common place in our tools for creating quality code.  However, we still run into several road blocks that often prevent us from writing a thorough suite of tests.  This session will suggest ways of solving 2 specific problems that I have personally experienced when trying to write suites of unit tests.  Specifically, I'll attempt to address:

* how to write test for older code libraries that do not currently have unit tests so that the code can be changed with confidence (a look at the new Fakes framework in VS 2012).
* how to write tests for logic/data access code that uses Entity Framework without hiding the flexiblilty of Entity Framework (note, I actually don't prefer the repository pattern).</description>

      <title>The Backup Tune-up</title>
      <description>Have you ever gotten tired of your 1TB database taking 4+ hrs to backup? Are you sick of having your users breathe down your neck for 2hrs because itâ€™s taking too long to restore a DB? Well now you donâ€™t have to worry about that anymore. Iâ€™m going to show you some little known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would a query. Backups actually have kind of an execution plan that you can access if you know how, and knowing how to get the individual portions of your backup process down will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. Iâ€™m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method Iâ€™ve used for 15yrs to tune my backups and Iâ€™ve had great success.</description>

      <description>Benchmarking, Baselines and Monitoring Storage
There are several steps in the life cycle of your storage systems. We have several tools to help us understand our storage systems from initial deployment through its useful life. 
We will cover:
SQLIO, a specific SQL Server benchmarking tool.
Iometer, a general IO benchmarking tool and simulator.
SQLIOSim a specific SQL Server base lining tool and simulator. 
TPC style testing focused on TPC-C, TPC-E and TPC-H.
Monitoring your system using WMI and virtual file stats.
Finally, what it all really means, how to read these results and compare them with each other.
With these tools you can plan, deploy and manage your storage for years to come!</description>

      <title>ASP.Net MVC and Workflow Foundation</title>
      <description>Workflow Foundation is a very powerful part of the .Net Framework that has been mostly ignored by the .Net development community.  The main reason developers don't learn it is because they just have no idea how to apply it to their current architectures.

This presentation focuses on using Workflow Foundation inside of an ASP.Net MVC application with a n-tiered architecture.  We will step through creating a workflow with Workflow Services and then we will see how to use the workflow from an ASP.Net MVC application.</description>

      <title>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</title>
      <description>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.</description>

      <description>Most developers are probably more familiar with the database first and model first design methods in Entity Framework, simply because these areas reached maturity earlier in the product life cycle.  However, beginning with Entity Framework 4.1, the code first method has also become fully developed.  This session will introduce you to the main concepts and core objects, methods, properties, etc. used to build your data access layer with code first methodology in Entity Framework.</description>
