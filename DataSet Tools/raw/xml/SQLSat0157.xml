      <title>Advancing Data Storage: How Flash-Optimized Storag</title>
      <description>Advancing Data Storage:
How Flash-Optimized Storage Architectures 
Accelerate Performance and Simplify Storage Management

This presentation will explore the evolution of storage architectures over the past 25 years, reviewing the technology inflection points and core business drivers that have propelled the transitions from direct attached to monolithic to modular storage solutions.  

We are at the beginning of the next major technology inflection driving enterprise storage. Solid state drives (SSDs) promise to solve the performance challenges inherent in spinning disks, rendering traditional storage architectures obsolete.    

But SSDs by themselves are not the solution. The next decade will be dominated by storage architectures</description>

      <title>Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight</title>
      <description>This 400 (or maybe 500) level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>Introduction to SSIS with a Real-World Example</title>
      <description>SSIS is a powerful and east to use data Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool SSIS providing a rich set of components to perform the most common ETL tasks with “drag-and-drop” ease. Packages can be constructed with rigorous error and exception handling as well as verbose logging allowing deployment of robust ETL processes.. This session will demonstrate a process for loading a comma-delimited data file into a staging table for further processing then validating the data and moving specific data into host tables using a a thorough example of a non-trivial ETL project with “real” data. The intended audience includes beginning SSIS developers, DBAs, and anyone with a desire to experience the magic of data management with this remarkable tool.</description>

      <title> Proactive Administration with Ring Buffers.</title>
      <description>Ring buffers were added in SQL Server 2005. They provide diagnostic data that can be used to troubleshoot server issues such as memory and CPU pressure. By storing this wealth of information in SQL Server, we can spot problems/trends and even resolve problems automatically without having to page the on-call DBA to fix it. In this session, we'll take a look at what ring buffers provides and also what we can do with the data. I'll show you a scenario that recently occurred in my environment and what I did to correct the problem before customers were even aware of it. The tool that I wrote can easily be placed in your environment and adapted to your needs.</description>

      <title>Working With XML In SQL Server </title>
      <description>XML is a technology that Developers and DBAs alike share a love-hate relationship with; it's powerful and flexible yet it can be bloated and difficult to work with at the same time. Regardless, XML has found a home in many applications - including SQL Server (e.g. execution plans) - so it's important to understand how to work with it in your databases. This session will show you how to use the XML data type, perform basic operations on XML data, and how to use FOR XML to create XML from relational data. This isn't a session to convince you to use XML, but to show you what you can do with XML when you do need to use it!

      <title>Discovering the Plan Cache</title>
      <description>Execution plans are stored after execution in the plan cache. This metadata about how queries are executed can provide insight into how your SQL Server environment is functioning. By using XQuery to browse and search the plan cache you can find potential performance issues and opportunities to tune your queries. This information can be used to help reduce issues related to parallelism, shift queries from using scans to using seek operations, or discover exactly which queries are using what indexes. All of this and more is readily available through the plan cache. In this session we will explore the plan cache and start you on the road to discovery. </description>

      <title>Parallel Query Plans - Good and Bad</title>
      <description>I will review the basics of Parallel Query Plans and discuss a variety of issues. Single CPU query plans can be very complicated. Multi CPU plans add another layer of complexity. There are benefits to using more than 1 CPU to run a query faster but there are also pitfalls. Why do some high cost queries only use 1 CPU? What about CXPACKET? Why can a parallel plan query run slower than the same query using only 1 CPU?  All new computers have multiple CPU cores. This has increased the relevance of parallel plan query execution.If you have questions or stories of parallel plan issues, please share your questions and experiences during this talk.</description>

      <title>Up Your Game With OUTPUT</title>
      <description>There are some classic database programming tasks that rely on answering the question "What did I just change?" Prior to SQL Server 2005, we had to use functions like SCOPE_IDENTITY() and some extra tricks for handling multiple rows. Some people even had to resort to triggers. Yikes!! This session focuses on the practical use cases for the T-SQL OUTPUT clause. More importantly, you will find out how you can ditch the tricks of the past for a simpler solution that will help keep you sane.</description>
