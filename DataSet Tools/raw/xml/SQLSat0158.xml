      <title>Microsoft's Big Play for Big Data</title>
      <description>Big Data entails collecting and analyzing large volumes of data obtained from Web, social media, scientific and other pools of fast-growing event-driven data. Recently, Microsoft announced its Windows Server and Windows Azure implementations of Hadoop, the open source distributed processing engine widely used in Big Data implementations. And the plot thickens, as Microsoft also fits SQL Server business intelligence (BI) tools on top of Hadoop, to make the analysis part of Big Data work with familiar and accessible Microsoft technologies.

Come to this session to get an overview of Big Data, Hadoop and its integration with te Microsoft BI stack. See how your skills can be applied to this rapidly growing part of the industry.</description>

      <title>Surviving Your Peak Database Load</title>
      <description>Each application and system is different, but all have a similar quality: there will be times where the systems are used more, and other times where they may appear to be sleeping. Good examples are monthly, quarterly, and yearly for financial systems and the holiday season for retail. The last thing you want to have in these time frames is your CxO standing at your desk wondering why things are slow or possibly down. Ensuring that your SQL Servers are optimally configured for those heavy usage periods cannot be done with a wing and a prayer – you need an actionable, realistic plan. This session will discuss how to guarantee that your SQL Server instances and the configurations they use are as scalable and reliable as possible.</description>

      <title>Mastering Date-Time Based Analysis in DAX</title>
      <description>A large volume of analysis that a business typically performs on its data involves dates and/or times. For example, you may need to compare sales from one year to the next or aggregate transactions over time. DAX incorporates many built in time intelligence functions to help make date-time based calculations easier. Although the time intelligence functions are very beneficial, they can be misused and give erroneous results. To avoid this, it is imperative that you understand what functions to use and how to use them. This session is designed to guide you through the various time intelligence functions available in DAX and provide practical examples of how to use them.

      <title>SQL Server 2012 Columnstore index</title>
      <description>It might seem far-fetched that a company would upgrade to SQL Server 2012 “just” for a database index.  But after you see the performance enhancements gained from the new columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, you’ll see why many are calling this one of the most important features in the history of SQL Server.  In this presentation, I’ll talk about the physical aspects of  columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, how to create it, and what environments  (mainly data warehousing environments) and queries can make use of it.  I’ll show performance benchmarks between columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2012, and compare them to index strategies prior to SQL Server 2012.  I'll also show how the new Batch execution mode can improve performance as well</description>

      <title>SQL Server Internals  Architecture</title>
      <description>Let’s face it. You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works. Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes. But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture. This session will answer questions like: - What’s different about 32- and 64-bit systems? - What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server? - How are queries handled behind the scenes? - What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers? - ...and much more.</description>

      <title>Full Text Indexing Basics</title>
      <description>Today's large data fields (LDF) are full of unstructured information stored in varchar, text, varbinary or xml data types.  How do you write an application to search the column for patterns?  Traditional SQL techniques using a column INDEX and LIKE operator result in a query plan that contains a full table scan.  I will be introducing the brother's grimm database that has the full text of each fairy tale.  I will create a full text catalog / index, select a change tracking strategy, define optional stop list / thesaurus file, and then populate the index.  I will use CONTAINS and FREETEXT operators in SELECT queries to leverage the FTI.  This resulting query plan performs index seek. </description>

      <title>Enriching Applications with SSAS Data Mining</title>
      <description>Data mining as a technology is designed to analyze large volumes of data looking for patterns that accurately predict behavior. These patterns can then be used to derive knowledge about data, and in turn this knowledge can be used to enhance application designs and the user experience. In this presentation, you will be introduced to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 Data Mining and demonstrations on how to develop data mining models that can be embedded into your applications. Demonstrations are based on SQL Server 2008 R2 Data Mining. This presentation is a must for any developer looking to embed “Artificial Intelligence” into their solution design to take their applications to the next level.</description>

      <title>SQL 2012 Error Handling. Pick your Destiny</title>
      <description>Gone are all the spaghetti errors of past versions of SQL. For example did you know that BEGIN TRAN…COMMIT TRAN is not enough to make everything work together? People are often shocked when they see the demo in this talk where the first statement fails and all others statements still commit. This can still happen to you in SQL 2012 if you are not aware of the options. In fact did you know that when SQL encounters an error of Severity 11 (or higher), there a 4 different ways it can react? Learn how to predict the Error Action and control it. This is possible with or without structured error handling. See both ways to control the outcome to the way you want it.</description>

      <title>SQL Azure Scalability with Federations</title>
      <description>With more and more companies moving to a cloud solution, the necessity to easily and efficiently scale their database solution is critical. This session will discuss how to scale SQL Azure using SQL Azure Federations, a recent addition to SQL Azure that provides the ability to build scalable, elastic, and multi-tenant solutions in SQL Azure. SQL Azzure Federations bring the sharding pattern into SQL Azure as a first class citizen as a way to achieve greater scalability and performance from the database tier of your application through horizontal partitioning at the database level. This session will look at Federations from a real-world point of view, by applying Federations to a real-life database. We will also look at performance benefits.</description>

      <title>Writing Faster Stored Procedures and Functions</title>
      <description>Stored procedures and functions are the mainstay of SQL Server coding. In this presentation you will learn techniques to locate problem  code and to improve it's performance.  Step 1 is to discover where the time is going using server traces, code to analyzes the traces, and the new Extended Events.  Once we know where the time is going we look at strategies to improve performance: Managing indexes on temp tables and why heaps are often the best choice for temp tables; determining if an index is helping; Rewriting scalar and multi-statement functions as inline functions and why it’s so important; mastering minimally logged operations and the “Go Faster” switch. Each technique is illustrated with examples</description>

      <description>You say you have a backup strategy, but what is your recovery strategy? 

In this session I will demonstrate several methods for performing much-needed backups and how to recover those backups to include FULL, DIFFERENTIAL, FILE GROUP, and TRANSACTION LOG.  He will also demo performing a peace meal restore as well as backing up and restoring the tail end of the log after the data file becomes corrupt.
 
I will discuss industry best practices for backing up and recovering your data.  The goal of this session is to educate you on the various backup strategies so you can decide which is best for your organization, demonstrate how to recover your databases, and to create the desire for you to go back and validate your current strategies</description>

      <title>Real World Integration Services: Excel Spreadsheet</title>
      <description>You rarely hear of a data integration project that doesn't involve a spreadsheet as a source document, a lookup reference, or an output. It's the ambiguously ubiquitous container for business data because it's so flexible and familiar to users. Unfortunately, the same features those business users crave tend to cause huge problems for data professionals.  
In this session we'll look at typical integration issues with Excel, explain why they occur, and show you more options than just the Excel Source or COM API.  In a world where spreadsheets are the "database of choice" for business users, knowing how to get SSIS to interact reliably with Excel is an essential skill.</description>

      <title>SSAS 2012 Tabular vs. Multidimensional</title>
      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-Managed BI with PowerPivot</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 PowerPivot will allow analysts to use Excel 2010 to load and prepare large volumes of data from various data sources to create a data model. The data model can then be enriched with calculations to become a data source for Excel PivotTable, PivotChart and CUBE function reports.

And as compelling as these BI experiences can be that’s not the end of the story. A PowerPivot workbook deployed to SharePoint Server 2010 can be used to create even more compelling BI experiences using Reporting Services and PerformancePoint Services.

In this presentation learn about the fundamentals of PowerPivot data model creation, and the exciting ways PowerPivot data models can be used to visualize and share data.</description>

      <description>PowerShell is a command-line scripting language primarily designed for system administration  development. Unlike VBScript or DOS batch files, PowerShell is built upon the .NET Platform which makes it customizable and extensible. This introductory session will show the PowerShell language constructs  scripts and how it can be used for SQL Server administration (using SMO  WMI providers) and development (ADO.Net  OLEDB providers).

      <title>Seven SQL Agent Jobs You Should be Running</title>
      <description>See those things around your ankles? You hope they're your socks because no DBA wants to be caught with their pants down.

Whether you're an accidental DBA, a DBA who has just inherited a bunch of servers, or someone who works in a shop that won't buy monitoring tools, this session will help you get basic monitoring in place to make sure you know what's going on in your environment.

You'll learn how to implement seven simple scripts that perk their ears up and start barking like a dog after a stranger walks in the house. They are the canary in your coal mine. You'll know when backups fail, when they run longer than usual, when data files are getting full, when transaction logs have excessive VLFs, and more.</description>

      <title>Much Ado about Indexes - Tips, Tricks and Tuning..</title>
      <description>In my session, I will offer some practical tips and tricks on a wide-array of Index Analysis methods that will allow you to find out everything about a client's indexes and were afraid to ask! What better way to optimize the performance of the database than talk about their indexes. What do you need to know in order to make these suggestions, and implement them. This session will cover the basics on indexes, and then demonstrate ways to improve DB performance. Missing Indexes, Duplicate Indexes, Fragmented Indexes, Covering Indexes, Clustered  Nonclustered indexes, and the queries that love them. I will also demo ways in which you can correlate the worst performing queries with missing indexes</description>

      <description>Creating a query plan can be a time consuming and expensive process. To avoid repeating these costly steps, SQL Server stores its query plans, in the plan cache where they can be reused as needed.
 
In this session, we’ll look at how the plan cache is organized, what plans are saved, when plans are reused and when they are recreated, methods for observing the contents of the plan cache, and finally, methods for manipulating plan reuse and recreation.

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>Creating a Performance Baseline for SQL Server</title>
      <description>Creating a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance provides many benefits including defining a starting point for optimization efforts, documenting the server, a reference point for capacity planning, and providing a reference for ongoing performance comparison.  This session will provide a detailed presentation of an approach for collecting, storing, and presenting performance metrics for use in developing a baseline performance assessment of a SQL Server instance.</description>

      <title>Hadoop and its Ecosystem Components in Action</title>
      <description>It’s one thing to have a high-level understanding of Big Data, Hadoop and MapReduce; it’s quite another to feel comfortable working with the tools. In this demo-heavy session, ZDNet Big Data blogger and Visual Studio magazine columnist Andrew Brust will take a look at actual MapReduce code and see Hadoop ecosystem components HBase, Hive, Pig and Mahout in action.</description>

      <title>Slowly changing dimensions- an integrated approach</title>
      <description>There are many treatments of table design for slowly changing dimenions, and almost as many on doing ETL on an SCD. Much less has been said about building a cube around a slowly changing dimension.
In this session, Mark will review the types of slowly changing dimensions, describe the performance implications of various methods of loading SCDs in SSIS (SCD task, Lookups, Merge, and Script component), and build the versioning directly into the dimension in Analysis Services</description>

      <title>Building Faster SQL Servers</title>
      <description>SQL Server speed boils down to how fast we can get data in and out of storage. Sooner or later, we're going to run out of memory to cache. In this session, we take a lesson from Microsoft's blazing-fast Fast Track Reference Architectures, look at why they work so well for the wildest queries, and explain how to build our own SQL Servers for quick queries. Brent Ozar shows you how to test your own servers and compares them to servers he's worked with in the field.</description>

      <title>What's new in SQL Server 2012 - from A to Z</title>
      <description>In this presentation, I'll go through all the new features in SQL Server 2012.  I won't cover any one area heavily - the goal is just to identify (and in some cases, briefly show) as many new features as possible....from the new columnstore index, to T-SQL enhancements, to a greatly iimproved SSIS tool, to a new model for creating analytic databases, and more.   SQL Server 2012 has a large amount of new functionality that helps all sorts of database developers.  After this presentation, I can almost promise you'll be VERY interested in upgrading to SQL Server 2012.</description>
