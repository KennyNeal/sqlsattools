      <title>Automating SSIS Development with Biml</title>
      <description>SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.</description>

      <title>SSIS Project Deployment Model</title>
      <description>In this session, we will look at the features of the SSIS Project Deployment Model in SQL 2012. Specific areas of interest include:Shared Connection Managers : Ability to create project level connection managers which can be shared across multiple packages within projectParameterization of package properties: Concept of parameters introduced through which properties within packages can be parameterized and set from outside for automated as well as interactive package execution using environment variable setsSeamless deployment and execution monitoring through SSIS catalog: Addition of new SSIS catalog DB for storing and managing the execution of packages and easy monitoring and auditing through improved set of standard reports</description>

      <title>Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services with DMVs</title>
      <description>Imagine having the power in your hands to quickly provide activity information about open connections to Analysis Services, memory usage by specific objects, or a list of cube measures in a connection. In this session, you'll discover the power of SQL Server Analysis Services Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that provide this information and so much more. These simple yet powerful views provide administrators with easy access to valuable information including current active sessions and connections, memory consumption, performance counters, and cube partitioning. In addition, DMVs also provide the ability to richly describe and document the structure of your cubes.</description>

Whether you're using SSRS, SSIS, or SSAS, Active Directory is one of the largest influencers.  We'll discuss how the location of your server in AD is important, how security can be compromised, AD DNS configuration, and of course Kerberos.  By the end of the session you'll have a check list of things to discuss with your domain administrator when you return to work.  This includes the biggest perpetrator, Group Policy Objects.</description>
