      <title>Reporting Services Deep Dive</title>
      <description>SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - New Features included in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. ** This session is SQL Saturday favorite and is always packed full.

      <title>Data Quality Services--Finally!</title>
      <description>Every organization that stores data stores dirty data, and suffers with how best to handle this unpleasant fact.Organizations must rely on people to deal with data problemseither by paying them to clean it or paying them to work around it. Either way it is costly and only becomes more so over time. Finally with the release of SQL Server 2012, there is a tool to help. Learn how to use the key parts of Data Quality Services: how to create a Knowledge Base, how to create Data Cleansing Projects to cleanse data both in the DQS client and inside SSIS 2012, and how DQS Matching Projects can integrate with Master Data Services for de-duplication of data. Session focuses on DQS, but also explains how DQS, MDS, and SSIS work together.</description>

      <title>End users have a short attention span</title>
      <description>As a BI Administrator or report designer, you've probably been asked many times by the business to create a dashboard to present some data. What makes a good dashboard though? The more information, the better? The more colors, the better? In this session you will get tips about designing dashboards, graphs, tables, gauges and maps with the goal of how you can impress your end user with the most efficient designed reports. This session is less technical than others, since it covers aspects and tips that you can take into consideration to create your reports as clear, understandable and usable as possible. The session consists of some general tips and tricks, followed by examples of designs and how to optimize these.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.</description>

      <title>Managing Schema Changes - Visual Studio and SSDT</title>
      <description>As systems grow and evolve, we need tools to help manage these changes, including tracking changes to the database schemas, producing scripts to synchronize the changes between servers, and refactoring the corresponding application code based on the new structures. You'll see how you can use tools in Visual Studio and SSDT to help manage these changes better.

      <description>Agile development is all the rage, but how do the principles apply to database administrators? This presentation will introduce the basics of the Agile Manifesto, and explain how they can be applied to non-development IT work, such as database administration, maintenance, and support. We’ll cover scrum (one of the most popular development methodologies) and kanban, and identify some of the common struggles with implementing them in an organization. This is an interactive discussion; please bring your tales of success and your horror stories.</description>

      <description>I don't know how the Sql Server will perform!  You can't do that! Yes, we can!  Yes, we did! It runs better than our physical server.  Need to add a CPU in less than 5 minutes, no problem. Need more memory, sure.  Give me 5 minutes.  Thin provisioning, thick provisioning? Can I put as many Sql Servers as I want on the Host?  What is a Host and a Guest? What is causing my Sql Server to run slow, is it the virtual, operating system or Sql Server? How do I know? What is the licensing for Sql Server? How do you monitor it? How is it working? Let’s find all of these answers.</description>

      <description>If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language.  Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply?  In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.</description>
