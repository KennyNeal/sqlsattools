      <title>Reporting Services Deep Dive</title>
      <description>SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - Features added in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. ** This session is SQL Saturday favorite and is always packed full. Don't miss it **</description>

      <title>Hello, My Name Is DAX</title>
      <description>For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without development access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. DAX is also used to join tables on multiple columns and to create calculated measures.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.  We will even show how to use DAX expressions to create new measures.</description>

      <description>So the big wigs have come up with a “master” report that shows everything you could ever want on a single report.  It includes grids and charts of varying sizes and complexities.  Did I mention they want it pretty as well?  In this session we will discuss how to use SQL Reporting Services 2008 R2 to bring it all together while avoiding the pit falls and mistakes.  The demonstration will show how to build a multi-page, dashboard style report to manage your report server showing a multitude of grids and charts.  We will discuss the challenges with data reuse and formatting while exploring techniques for getting them to work.  To get the most out of this session, you should be able to build a report in SSRS. </description>

      <description>SQL Server 2012 debuts a new Semantic Platform (commonly known as the applied task, Semantic Search). This text mining technology leverages the already established Full Text Index, and builds semantic indexes in a two-phase process. This presentation provides a science description and demo for the Enterprise implementation of Tag Index and Document Similarity Index. At present (RC0), the indexes work for 15 languages. Included are strategy tips for how to best leverage the technology along with already-existing Microsoft text mining and data mining.</description>

      <description>Implement an SSIS Framework to track the progress of  SSIS production packages similar to how you can in the BIDS Designer, and explore your package withs  windows explorer like capability.Utilizing  the “out of the box” SSIS Logging with no changes required to the existing  logic or packages. The new framework  will also use SSIS to scan existing packages and automatically discover Master / Child package relationships and providing a capability for package restartability. This design pattern can be use to replace earlier “Stored Proc” version of SSIS Framework greatly reducing the code required. This functionality is complementary to the 2012 Package Tracking capability.</description>

      <title>Let’s get parallel</title>
      <description>Have you ever wondered how Microsoft and Unisys loaded 1TB of data in 30 minutes?  They used as many parallel processes as possible.  This session will walk through a solution that makes heavy use of parallel processing.  We will look at the use of scope to isolate threads and script tasks to determine and spread the workload across multiple threads. Additionally, we will look at how to determine how many parallel processes should be run on a single server and techniques to spread loads over multiple servers.    </description>

      <title>Cube World for Flat Table Landers</title>
      <description>This session will explore the tabular approach to building cubes in SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 for DBA’s more comfortable with relational databases.  Starting with a ‘normal’ relational database, you will learn how to define your measure and dimensions, define hierarchies, and build functional cubes that can be used to answer management’s questions about what is really going on with their data.  For users already familiar with PowerPivot, this session provides a good transition into the world of SSAS as well for their more demanding models.</description>
