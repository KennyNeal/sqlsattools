      <title>The Cloud is Coming for Your Career - Buwahahahaha</title>
      <description>Oh noes! Everyone tells me to throw away all my servers, and just move everything to the cloud! What will happen to my job? How will my children go to college? Buck Woody, Senior Technical Specialist on Windows Azure will answer these other questions, including: Why do they call something technical a “cloud”, since a cloud is something with undefined borders made of vapor? Isn’t this just the latest hype, a new buzzword that will soon be gone? Is anyone really using it for production? Are there real reasons to do that? If it’s real, how does it affect my job as a technical professional? What do I need to learn, and where can I learn it? This isn’t sales or marketing - a technical discussion on architectures and how they affect what you do.</description>

      <title>Understanding Indexes</title>
      <description>We all know indexes can speed up queries. But why? And how? Why is “index on every column” not a good indexing strategy, why is your shiny new index not used, and why can adding indexes even hurt performance?
The key to answering this is understanding how SQL Server lays out your data on disk, how this changes when you add an index, and how SQL Server uses these indexes to find the information required for your queries.
In this presentation, Hugo explains (with animated visualization) how heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes are organized on disk, and used for scans, seeks, and lookups. Armed with this information, you should be able to find just the right set of indexes for your workload.</description>

      <title>Powershell Smoke for SQL Server Mirrors</title>
      <description>SQL Server mirrors are a great way to maintain highly available, fast-failover systems that run on independent disk sets. While it is easy enough to work through the GUI or T-SQL to manage your mirrors, if you have a lot of them, the processes can become tedious. Also, there is not a fast easy way to tear down and build up a mirror after something goes wrong.
I’ll show how I leveraged some of the SMO mirroring objects, so that I could not only build and tear down database mirrors efficiently, but to also monitor their health. These same objects can be used to build mirror-aware applications, or ones that could automate the provisioning of highly available databases for critical applications.</description>

      <title>The Accidental Programmer</title>
      <description>Most people in the database world have heard of the term, "The Accidental DBA", those programmers who have to work with databases. How about the other side of the coin? What about DBA's an Dev's who have to write code or have to work closely with programmers? This presentation is a best practices guide for working with SQL Server in a .Net environment. You will learn how to recognize when bad code is written that interacts with the database, how to track it down, and most importantly how to fix it. On top of that you will also receive an introduction to object oriented programming concepts such as data abstraction, encapsulation, tier architecture, and class objects so that you can better communicate with your programmers.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting SQL Server with PowerShell</title>
      <description>It is normal for us to have to face poorly performing queries or even complete failure in our SQL server environments. This can happen for a variety of reasons including poor Database Designs, hardware failure, improperly-configured systems and OS Updates applied without testing. As Database Administrators, we need to take precaution to minimize the impact of these problems when they occur, and so we need the tools and methodology required to identify and solve issues quickly. In this Session we will use PowerShell to explore some common troubleshooting techniques used in our day-to-day work as s DBA. This will include a variety of such activities including Gathering Performance Counters in several servers at the same time in async mode.</description>

      <description>As much as you love SQL Server, do you cringe anytime you hear that you’ll need to stand up yet another SQL Server instance? Sure it’s fun, but who has the time? Maybe you’ve thought there must be a better way of doing this?  Sure, you have the ability to generate an unattended install file, but what about all the other things that will need to be done?  In this talk, we will explore a process that was created to truly automate not just the SQL Server install, but all of the configurations and the deployment of your organizations standard objects, all using a set of PowerShell scripts that you can download and use today. This session will review the process that has saved hundreds of hours for one organization and can do the same for yours.</description>

      <title>Killer Techniques for Database Performance</title>
      <description>No matter how much you tune your code, if the database is slow your application will be slow. While there are as many ways to make a database faster as there are databases, there are universal principles to apply that make the performance tuning process easier. Learn how to identify indexes, understand execution plans, and configure storage.

The database the most critical piece of any environment; performance problems in the database cascade outward to effect everyone. This talk will cover tried and true techniques to ease the pain of growing a database while improving application performance from the perspective of both a large enterprise and a small business. </description>

      <title>Running SQL Server 2012 on Server Core: Why  How</title>
      <description>Security and Performance are always two of the top issues for SQL Server DBAs.  Until recently the cost of the Operating System was something that you had almost no control over, but with SQL Server 2012 (Denali) you now have the option of running on the Core edition of Windows Server.  While Core edition has been used primarily for infrastructure servers like Domain Controllers and DNS servers, SQL Server 2012 now brings support for running the database engine on it.  This session will talk about when you may want to consider running SQL on Server Core and will guide you through the task of installing and configuring your server when you no longer have most of the Windows configuration tools that you may be used to.</description>

      <title>Introducing SQL Server Data Tools. (Project Juneau</title>
      <description>Your final scripts deployed to the live database a few months ago and almost everything went perfectly. Since then you have heard there were few index patches needed maybe even a new column in one or the tables. The live database has drifted just a little from your deployed SQL scripts. How would you like to update your next baseline code to already resemble the current state of the production database? This is just one of the incredible features you can do with SSDT. Take the statefull nature of your database to create and test your code automatically and declaratively. Database developers can use the SQL Server Object Explorer in VS to easily. See how the new scripting and automation tools are used in SQL 2012 with SSDT.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Common Table Expressions in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it. With the Common Table Expressions class you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query. Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's. One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which not only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server.  Learn how recursive CTE’s perform better than other methods to create hierarchical results.  See how CTE’s compare to SQL Server 2012 offset and fetch paging techniques.  </description>

      <description>It's an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. My goals in this presentation are to show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for proper usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of imappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition, I will cover serveral data type related functions and point out caveates in their usage.</description>

      <title>Introduction to SQL Server 2012 MDS and DQS</title>
      <description>This presentation introduces the upgraded features of SQL Server 2012 Master Data Services (MDS) and the new service, SQL Server 2012 Data Quality Services (DQS).

MDS is a solution for master data management. First released in SQL Server 2008 R2, this upgraded version includes many new features and enhancements, including a new web interface developed with Silverlight, an Excel add-in to support simplified model creation and easier data updates and management.

DQS is a new knowledge-driven data cleansing solution, and it supports building knowledge bases that provide correction and de-duplication of data.</description>

      <title>Recovering from Corruption</title>
      <description>Corruption cannot always be avoided. You can take steps to ensure early detection, and you can prepare for the eventuality of it occurring, but it's not possible to completely prevent it. Early detection is your best protection against data lost due to corruption.

In this session, we will discuss the protections within SQL Server to help identify corruption and to help recover from it. We will look at the different types of corruption that could hit your database and the best way to deal with each type. Includes live demos recovering from different types of corrupt databases.</description>

      <title>Building Faster SQL Servers</title>
      <description>SQL Server speed boils down to how fast we can get data in and out of storage. Sooner or later, we're going to run out of memory to cache. In this session, we take a lesson from Microsoft's blazing-fast Fast Track Reference Architectures, look at why they work so well for the wildest queries, and explain how to build our own SQL Servers for quick queries. Brent Ozar shows you how to test your own servers and compares them to servers he's worked with in the field.</description>

      <title>The Most Ignored Best Practices</title>
      <description>Everyone would agree that setting up, configuring, and applying best practices to a database server environment, is always easier to do in the early stages of deployment.   Yet too often, environments are built, grow, and become business critical, without such efforts completed until performance and stability become a problem.  This session will discuss how this keeps occurring, how we can avoid it from continuing, and some basic standards that should be found in almost any environment.</description>

      <description>So you know all about heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes, but are still not satisfied? Then this is just the session for you!
Hugo will explore advanced features such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will find out how they are stored on disk, and how SQL Server uses them to satisfy queries. Then, you will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes. And finally, you will get an stunning demonstration of just how bad you can hurt performance by following all those recommendations and creating too many indexes.</description>

      <description>Fixing bad data is a huge problem. How about if you could design your schema so that it checked the data on the way in?

The beginner-level techniques here are very important and useful: primary key, alternate key/unique index, foreign key, etc. But what else can you do to lock down the data in your database? You will leave this session with a better understanding of the normal techniques and some new ones that you probably haven't used before.</description>
