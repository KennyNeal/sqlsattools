      <title>The Art of Questions and success as an IT Pro</title>
      <description>Data professionals spend a lot of time asking questions. You spend countless hours refining your techcial skills but how much time do you spend learning researching and practicing the art of asking questions? 

What might happen to your career if you did? 

This session presents a bit of theory on the art and science of questions. Here's a question for you: Did you know that asking "why" questions can make people feel defensive and can color the way they respond to you? Strange but true. We'll review some of the biggest mistakes you can make when asking questions and I’ll offer a few some tips on how you can turn mediocre questions into great questions. 

And oh yeah. I'll leave time for asking questions at the end.

      <title>“ColumnStore” Indexes for Fast EDW Query</title>
      <description>This session will introduce the new xVelocity Memory-Optimized Columnstore Index feature of SQL 2012. This presentation will describe what a column store index is, how this feature is used to store data by columns instead of by rows and compare the advantages and disadvantages between the two storage methods. Live demos will explore how to create columnstore indexes, when to create them, best practices for using them and typical data warehouse scenarios that can leverage the columnstore index to drastically speed up data warehouse queries, in many cases by a factor of 10 to 100, so you are equipped to start implementing this feature into your database environment.</description>

Over at LinkedIn there is Group run by Henrik Liliendahl Sorensen for Data Matching, Bill Winkler, principal researcher at the US Census" has written a series of white papers on record linkage and particular a technique called "Blocking Indexs". In addition we wil cover William Cohen Research Professor, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University white papers an implementations.

      <title>SQL Server 2012 Columnstore index</title>
      <description>It might seem far-fetched that a company would upgrade to SQL Server 2012 “just” for a database index.  But after you see the performance enhancements gained from the new columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, you’ll see why many are calling this one of the most important features in the history of SQL Server.  In this presentation, I’ll talk about the physical aspects of  columnstore index in SQL Server 2012, how to create it, and what environments  (mainly data warehousing environments) and queries can make use of it.  I’ll show performance benchmarks between columnstore indexes in SQL Server 2012, and compare them to index strategies prior to SQL Server 2012.  I'll also show how the new Batch execution mode can improve performance as well</description>

      <title>Using Expressions to Avoid Three SSRS Annoyances</title>
      <description>As powerful as it is, SQL Server Reporting Services still has frustrating annoyances. Three in particular are: 1) non-queried parameter values must be entered one value at a time, with lots of clicking along with way; 2) the page header and page footer sections cannot contain data regions and therefore cannot display sets of data-driven values; and 3) matrix reports promise the analytical ability of Excel PivotTables but fall short because they are fixed and lack the ability to dynamically slice-and-dice data by values selected by the user. With the expression techniques taught in this session, these annoyances will annoy no longer because you will be able to work around all three.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX: The (Very) Basics</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.</description>

      <title>PerfTuning: Intro To Execution Plan Analysis</title>
      <description>Topic will provide a more in depth look into query execution plans and is targeted for junior to senior DBA’s. You will learn how to identify what indexes are being used by the SQL optimizer, different type of index operations that are performed by SQL server and what operations are generally considered as a preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if indexes used by the optimizer are the optimal ones and the exceptions to the rules.   Finally we will discuss the relationship between different types of index operation and different types of join types within SQL Server including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use and pros and cons of each type.  </description>

      <title>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration</title>
      <description>Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.</description>

      <title>Virtualizing SQL 2012: Doing It Right</title>
      <description>A database is a very resource intensive by its very nature and one of the most resource intensive applications you will ever virtualize. If best practices are not followed, the database will never perform as needed. This presentation will teach the DBA how to virtualize a business critical application like SQL server 2012. It will be based upon experience learned using VMWare as the virtualization platform. But many of the lessons taught will carry over to any virtualized platform. </description>

      <description>In this session, we will walk through the process of building a spatial data
warehouse from the ground up. We will first design a basic spatial data
warehouse, then identify and import a spatial data source by using Microsoft
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and finally write a spatial query to
provide data to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). We will also review
basic concepts of working with spatial data in SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Common TSQL Mistakes</title>
      <description>We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented.
