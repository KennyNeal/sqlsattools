      <title>StreamInsight: Complex Event Processing by MS</title>
      <description>The number of sensors is growing and growing and brings us closer to the "Internet of things". Applications, that have to process a big amount of data from event streams are a logical consequence. Some developers might have heard from Reactive Extensions (Rx) already, but Microsoft offers with StreamInsight (SI) another comprehensive platform for these scenarios.

In this session you will learn what a great addition for your toolbox StreamInsight is, if you have to develop applications, that have to handle complex events (CEP- Complex Event Processing). See how you can start with this technologie and how easy it is to jump in for .NET developers.</description>

      <title>Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware</title>
      <description>The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.</description>

      <title>UDFs, or: How to kill performance in one easy step</title>
      <description>User-defined functions in SQL Server are very much like custom methods and properties in .Net languages. At first sight, they seem to be the perfect tool to introduce code encapsulation and reuse in T-SQL. So why is this feature mostly avoided by all T-SQL gurus?
The reason is performance. In this session, you will learn how user-defined functions feed the optimizer with misleading and insufficient information, how the optimizer fails to use even what little information it has, and how this can lead to shocking query performance.
However, you will also see that there is a way to avoid the problems. With just a little extra effort, you can reap the benefits of SQL Server and still get good performance.</description>

      <title>Advanced Data Visualisation with Reporting Service</title>
      <description>As a report creator and designer, it's your role to make the message of the data come alive for data consumers and decision-makers. This requires a balance between conveying the 'truth' of the data across to the target audience, in addition to making the report look interesting that it will draw people's attentions in the first place.

SSRS is one of the most widely-used Business Intelligence products within the Microsoft stack. Come to this session to pick up some tips and tricks for advanced reporting writing, that is also  in accordance with thinking by Data Visualisation gurus such as Stephen Few and Edward Tufte.
This session will cover more advanced and less well-known features of reporting services with Data Viz in mind!</description>

      <title>Optimizing implementation techniques</title>
      <description>This session describes some performance boosters as well as performance killers and some techniques that can lead T-SQL queries, functions and stored procedures to take a few seconds instead of lots of minutes to execute.

For instance: 
- What is best, CTE’s or Temporary Tables? When?
- When joining more than two tables (or intermediate result sets), should we still care about the join order?
- Did you ever expect to see an Index Seek in your execution plan but what you find is an Index Scan, although you took care of parameter sniffing and your statistics are updated?
- Do you care about what isolation level you use?

Using real life based demonstrations, this session will provide answers to these and other questions.</description>

      <title>SQL Azure Scalability with Federations</title>
      <description>With more and more companies moving to a cloud solution, the necessity to easily and efficiently scale their database solution is critical. This session will discuss how to scale SQL Azure using SQL Azure Federations, a recent addition to SQL Azure that provides the ability to build scalable, elastic, and multi-tenant solutions in SQL Azure. SQL Azzure Federations bring the sharding pattern into SQL Azure as a first class citizen as a way to achieve greater scalability and performance from the database tier of your application through horizontal partitioning at the database level. This session will look at Federations from a real-world point of view, by applying Federations to a real-life database. We will also look at performance benefits.</description>

      <title>How to outsource yourself with a Powershell script</title>
      <description>Well, kidding of course. Someone needs to maintain those scripts :-)
But there is a lot of repetitive work that can easily be scripted. 
And powershell is so versatile that it can be used to make scripts that "think" the way a DBA thinks. 
It will solve problems or complete a task for you that includes reacting to various (un)expected circumstances.
I will show you how to use some cool new features of Powershell 3,  like workflows and web access, and I'll use some of my own scripts to demonstrate how this all comes together.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Solving Sort Warning Problems</title>
      <description>Sometimes SQL Server spills sort operation to tempdb although there is no memory pressure. Why and when it happens and why SQL Server raises a "Sort Warnings" event and what does it mean you can find in this session. We will see how to identify this problem in SQL Server 2008 and more elegant in SQL Server 2012 and of course we can discuss how to prevent this problem.</description>

      <title>Dr. DMV: How to Use Dynamic Management Views</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2008 R2 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session (which is applicable to SQL Server 2005 through 2012), presents and explains over fifty DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment.</description>

      <title>CAST([Transaction Log] as T.SQL) </title>
      <description>The aim of this session is to take the audience in a quest for the original (or equivalent) T-SQL, that was in the origin of the different transactions recorded, by inspecting the transaction log records and dissecting its data. In a session that tackles several internals storage issues, needed to fulfill its objective, we will go in a travel that starts by the end of the log and will, hopefully, only end at the birth of the database.</description>

      <title>Geospatial Data Types in SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>The geospatial capabilities in SQL Server are not only powerful, but easy and fun to use! In this session, Lenni shows you how to integrate location-awareness into your own applications with the geometry and geography data types. We’ll explore the planar and geodetic spatial models, spatial markup languages such as WKT and GML, and then put these concepts to use as we build several useful demos, (e.g., Bing Maps integration). Demos show how to use the geospatial methods to easily calculate area, length, and distance, and project new shapes based on intersection and overlap. Attend this session and embrace spatial programming today!</description>

      <description>Transactional Replication exists in SQL Server since 1995; It's an stable solution, reliable and scalable 
if it's used properly. Obviously is not a solution for everything so you will have to decide wether this technology
fits for your needs or not. In this session we will introduce the main concepts about transactional replication and two real cases to show the scale-out benefits
of this technology. At the end we will talk about common best practices for transactional replication.</description>
