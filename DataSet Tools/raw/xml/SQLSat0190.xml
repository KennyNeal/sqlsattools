      <title>Implementing Data Partitioning and Tiered Storage</title>
      <description>Support of the large databases is not a trivial task. Large amount of data negatively impacts system performance and make administration and SLA compliance much more complicated. Data partitioning can help to solve those problems and reduce support and hardware cost. This session demonstrates various approaches of data partitioning available in SQL Server. It compares pros and cons of different partitioning techniques from performance, scalability and administration standpoints. The session also discusses how to reduce hardware cost by implementing tiered storage and demonstrates how to move data between filegroups and/or disk arrays keeping the system online in the different versions and editions of SQL Server. </description>

      <title>SQL Server Murder Mystery Hour: Dead Reports Don't Talk</title>
      <description>SABOTAGE? MURDER?

Before a pivotal meeting to secure venture capital, a key report vanishes from the server without a trace, leaving Cromulent Technologies' future in jeopardy. Our group must solve the crime. Time is critical as the CEO has promised to explain the matter to investors just sixty minutes from now. Only with your investigative skills, SQL Server knowledge, and teamwork can we find the missing report, bring the perpetrator to justice, and save Cromulent Technologies!

SQL Server Murder Mystery Hour is part technical presentation, part networking event. We'll focus on Reporting Services administration in areas that are vital to business continuity: security roles, encryption keys, and backups. All attendees have a part to play.</description>

      <title>SQL Server encryption 3 ways - in transit, at rest and in the database</title>
      <description>Dude, where's my keys??!?!

Confused about the various ways SQL Server handles encryption? Tasked with securing your environment or trying to pass an audit? There's a lot of information that can be difficult to wade through. In this session, I'll go over three ways to encrypt SQL Server, showing practical examples of the various techniques. We'll look at encrypting the information at the network level (in transit), encrypting the data and backup files (at rest using Transparent Data Encryption) and encryption of sensitive information in the database (columns and stored procedures). 

This will be a high level, hands-on discussion that will enable any administrator to put the techniques discussed into practice immediately.  You'll see how encryption will fit into your overall security scheme.</description>

      <title>Maximizing SSIS Package Performance</title>
      <description>So you've developed a whiz-bang SSIS package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and.... nothing happens - or it moves verrrrry slowly. Or perhaps you've got packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

In this demo-packed session, we'll work through some of the most common causes of performance bottlenecks in SSIS packages, along with recommended practices for maximizing performance. Among the topics we'll cover: troubleshooting methods to detect performance hotspots; optimizing sources and destinations for maximum throughput; choosing the most efficient data flow transformations; and using parallelism to improve performance.</description>

      <title>Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware</title>
      <description>The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.

      <description>You just received a phone call from your boss telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is underperforming, hogging resources or timing out, the first thing you want to examine is the query execution plan. An execution plan provides a wealth of information that can help you quickly diagnose what is wrong. In this beginner level session you will learn what an execution plan is, how to find it, and how to interpret it to see what the query optimizer is doing and find the major pain points</description>

      <title>How flash storage modernizes databases and tips for tuning databases for all flash arrays</title>
      <description>For decades the characteristics of spinning hard drives have acted as a tail wagging the dog requiring the processes and behaviors of software, architecture and administrators to bend to its requirements.  With the advent of a new technology, flash storage, comes the unleashing of a new round of performance potential as well as a shedding of long encumbering patterns.  Modernizing databases is about both vastly boosting performance and also significantly reducing the complexity and effort to maintain them.  Come see a deep dive into how ultra-fast and random-optimized storage is modernizing database performance, architecture and maintenance.</description>

      <description>In the life of a DBA, we rarely get to experience an actual disaster. And by “actual disaster”, we aren’t just talking about an UPDATE without a WHERE clause on a live table. At the end of October 2012, Hurricane Sandy ravaged much of the New Jersey/New York area, causing business impacts up and down the Eastern seaboard. In this talk, I’ll share experiences from my first disaster, covering what went well, what didn’t, and what we’ve put into place since to help in the future.</description>
