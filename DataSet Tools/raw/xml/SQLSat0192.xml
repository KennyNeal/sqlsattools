      <title>Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems</title>
      <description>Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers? After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels. This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel. No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools. You can do this with the tools you have and I’ll give you the scripts to get started. Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.</description>

      <title>Reporting Services Deep Dive</title>
      <description>SQL Server Reporting Services is a fundamental part of Microsoft’s Business Intelligence suite of products which as its name suggests provides a centralized robust reporting solution for organizations. Using a familiar development environment we can create static and interactive reports that can be delivered to consumers in a variety of ways. In this deep dive session, I will cover topics like: - What is reporting services and what can it be used for? - Features added in 2008 R2 - Architectural Overview - Demonstrations to cover the entire process of developing, deploying and rendering reports using the built in Report Manager and URL Access. ** This session is SQL Saturday favorite and is always packed full.

      <title>SQL Internals , Recovery Models, and Backups! OH M</title>
      <description>The more you know about SQL Server the more you understand how it works.  SQL Server is a product we use every day, and most of us know the big concepts.  At the 10,000 foot view we know what  Databases, Tables, and Columns are.   But what makes up those Databases, Tables, and Columns.  What are Records, Pages, Extents, and Allocation Units?  What are Full, Simple, and Bulk-Logged Recovery?  What are the differences between  Full, Transaction Log, Differential, or Filegroup backups?  What is a Peicemeal Restore?  This is an introduction to these concepts using SQL 2012.  In this session you will learn about the internal Structure, Recovery Models, and Backups and be better prepared to for Future Learning and Managing SQL!</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server in Production</title>
      <description>Virtualization has been growing in popularity for years and changes in Windows Server 2012 and ESX 5 make it so that even high end workloads that demand large amounts of memory, significant I/O, and lots of processing power can be virtualized.  With over 8 years of experience virtualizing SQL Server in production, SQL Server MVP Jonathan Kehayias knows what it takes to successfully virtualize SQL Server for production workloads.  This session will explain the features that make virtualizing SQL Server possible using both VMware and Hyper-V, and will explain the most common problems businesses encounter trying to virtualize SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Tuning Analysis Services Processing Performance</title>
      <description>You’ve got your Analysis Services cube created, and deployed in production. However, you notice that every night, the cube is taking longer and longer to process, and users are starting to complain about their data not being ready when they arrive in the morning. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or want to avoid being in it in the first place, come to this session. We’ll cover how to benchmark processing performance, track down bottlenecks, and how to tune things to get the best performance for processing your cube.</description>

      <title>Partitioning for Perf and Management</title>
      <description>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning seamlessly solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</description>

      <title>Hello, My Name is DAX</title>
      <description>For anyone doing serious work with PowerPivot, you know that you must sometimes create additional columns calculated from the data in your existing data sources.  If your data source is SQL Server, you could do this in SQL directly by just connecting to a custom view.  However, for most other data sources (and for those users without development access to SQL Server) the best alternative is building expressions in PowerPivot to define new columns. DAX is also used to join tables on multiple columns and to create calculated measures.  This session will explore DAX functions and expressions and how they differ from Excel expressions.  We will even show how to use DAX expressions to create new measures.</description>

      <title>Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!</title>
      <description>In a world...where DBAs are blamed, mistreated, and overworked...one man...WILL. GET. EVEN. In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up. Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, cursors and missing WHERE clauses, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem. And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!</description>

      <description>In this session we'll use SSIS in a real-world example to automate processes. We'll look at using Variables and Expressions. We'll look at several items in the Control Flow that can be used to automate a lot of integration processes. We'll import data from MS Excel, save it to a database, export aggregated data into a different format, archive the data source, zip the data source, encrypt the exported file, and submit it via SFTP or email.</description>

      <title>Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!</title>
      <description>SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

      <title>Using PowerShell To Document Your SQL Envronment</title>
      <description>We've all been here before: 
- You're the DBA and it seems like every day someone is telling you about some other server you never knew existed but you're responsible for 
- You're the consultant and you want to know what SQL Servers your new client has but they can't tell you 
- You're the IT Manager and your CTO asks you for an inventory of every SQL Server running in production 

How do you go about figuring out where the SQL Servers are, how they're set up, and what they're doing? 

This session will give you the answer by demonstrating how to use PowerShell and SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) to discover and document all of your instances - no PowerShell experience required!

      <title>Building a SSIS Business Rules Engine</title>
      <description>While DQS in SQL Server 2012 is a powerful tool for enforcing data quality through business rules, often times the time and complexity it takes to set-up is overkill for more mundane common problems. This session will focus on implementing a business rules engine in a SSIS custom component. A flexible, metadata-driven solution will be discussed including considerations for implementation as a custom SSIS component. </description>

      <description>In this session Dmitri continues to talk about locking in Microsoft SQL Server. He covers more advanced concepts related to locking such as Schema Locks, Application Locks, Lock Escalation and Optimistic Isolation Levels and discusses how to choose the right transaction strategy for the system. 

This is PowerPoint-free session. Only Management Studio, T-SQL Code and bag of candies are in use. Assuming there are still some candies left :) </description>
