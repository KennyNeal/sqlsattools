      <title>Pivoting Performance Data  Pinpointing Problems</title>
      <description>Have you ever been wrought with end user complaints of database performance issues only to open your tools that show only live performance or limited historical performance and find no answers? After being bit by this many times, I developed my own eye in the sky to monitor CPU  Physical IO at the database, user and application levels. This solution logs data continuously and parses it into an Analysis Services cube which can be queried by Excel. No need to requisition funds for 3rd party tools. You can do this with the tools you have and I’ll give you the scripts to get started. Using these tools I have been able to find needles in haystacks and effectively communicate the nature of the problems to people at all levels.

      <title>Introduction to SQL executions plans</title>
      <description>Have you ever seen an execution plan and been totally lost as to what it means or what you can learn from it? We'll cover the basics of execution plans - how the SQL Server assembles the query, different types of joins, and why the query engine makes those decisions. We'll also look at common reasons why the query optimizer can make less-than-optimal decisions, and how you can improve the query layout or the the object metadata to help improve the execution plan and speed up the results.</description>

      <title>Enterprise Tabular Models</title>
      <description>Tabular models in SQL Server 2012 give us a powerful analytic engine that is faster and easier to implement than traditional multi-dimensional cubes using Analysis Services. In this session, you'll see how to develop analytic models using your existing data sources and learn best practices for preparing data so that it can be effectively used as a Tabular database. In addition to creating the model, you'll see how to quickly add measures, hierarchies, and calculated columns to provide a rich user experience and how the model works with Excel, SSRS and other reporting tools.</description>

      <title>Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration</title>
      <description>Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Monitoring Databases on VMware</title>
      <description>SQL Server on VMware???  Many of our customers are either virtualizing databases or planning to do so soon. I hear from many groups that attempted running their database on VMware but went back to physical hardware because of performance issues. There are many reasons this may have happened, but quite often the decision to go back to physical was not based on hard facts. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of monitoring databases running in a VMware environment. If you are using classic O/S monitoring tools, you may be getting misleading data. Understand what metrics are important and how to get to that data.</description>

      <title>Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular</title>
      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with SSAS 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX:  The (Very) Basics</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</description>

      <description>It depends, every situation is different. The question is often asked of DBA's to provide a solution to very open ended requirements.  However, the best solution can only be provided if the database professional is getting all the answers.  This session is a case study into many of Disaster Recovery options that we as database professionals have.  Understand the answers to the important questions that  we should be asking to provide the best solution not only for the database but for the business as well.  As an attendee you will learn how to change an answer from it depends into a solid solution that can be built upon. We will take examples from experiences and as a group determine what the best solution is. </description>

      <title>OnPremise to Azure</title>
      <description>During this talk I'll walk you through the process actually used to migrate a client's systems from hosted in a company closet to multiple Microsoft Azure data centers. Along the way we'll discuss the planning that went into the migration, the testing we went through, the pain points we hit, all the way to up and running in the cloud. This session covers the roadmap, we won't go through the actual migration itself...that took almost a year to complete.</description>

      <title>The Significance of Choosing and Using Data Types</title>
      <description>It's an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. My goals in this presentation are to show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for proper usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of imappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition, I will cover serveral data type related functions and point out caveates in their usage.</description>

      <title>Tabular Models</title>
      <description>Tabular modules allow developers to create models based upon different data sources; create hierarchies, perspectives, partitions and roles similar to traditional OLAP cubes.  In this session will highlight the differences between traditional OLAP and tabular models and reasons for selecting one approach over another. I will demonstrate how to create a data model first in power pivot model and then import into an Analysis Services Tabular Project.  Working with the imported data I will then create measures, KPIs, perspectives, and implement security. Finally I will deploy the model to an Analysis Server.</description>

      <title>Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>One of the new features of SQL Server 2012 is columnstore indexes, where the storage of index data is “turned on its head”. We will look into how this feature is implemented internally, how it can greatly improve query performance in the right environment, what the current limitations are, and how to implement workarounds for those limitations.</description>

      <title>A Heart ot Heart with the Business User</title>
      <description>This session discusses how we can deliver a better BI product if we learn to better communicate with the business user and get then to think differently about data and about their needs.

Attendees will gain an understanding of how to initiate conversations and begin a process of increasing the quality of user requirements. They will also learn how to start and develop this process to get user buy in. The end goal is to fully utilize BI capabilities to reduce costs, improve performance or identify new business opportunities.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.

It is an amazing tool. I do not work for Delphix I just believe that this tool is one of the most useful tools that I have seen in a long while. This product also has great ROI as you will see in the session</description>

      <title>Global Address Data: Storage and Verification</title>
      <description>This session will focus on the differences in address format and structure around the world and how that can place in the effective storage of "useful" address data within the Enterprise. In addition, we’ll discuss how address data is "mangled" to be stored and how it can impact the overall quality level of any tool used for address validation and correction internationally. With 240+ countries and territories around the world, this is not a small consideration.</description>

      <title>SSRS – Implementing a Rendering Extension</title>
      <description>In SSRS, a rendering extension is a component or module of a report server that transforms report data and layout information into a device-specific format. Out of the box, SSRS includes seven rendering extensions: HTML, Excel, Word, CSV, XML, Image, and PDF. During this presentation, Josh will show how to implement and deploy a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) rendering extension for SSRS. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format commonly used in rich client web applications.</description>
