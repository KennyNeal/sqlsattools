      <title>Data-driven Subscription using SSIS and SharePoint</title>
      <description>SQL Server Reporting Services provides data-driven subscriptions to render reports based on information in a database table. This is a very nice feature but the down side is that you are required to purchase an Enterprise license (or BI license in SQL 2012) of SQL Server in order to use this feature. Customers like this feature but don't want to pay for the Enterprise license so I searched for an alternative with standard licenses. In this session I will show the alternative where the end user can still create his own subscription in SharePoint. Step-by-step  I will create an SQL Server Integration Services package that renders reports to a SharePoint library on values stored in the database.</description>

      <title>Power View from the Data Visualisation Perspective</title>
      <description>Power View is Microsoft's Data Visualisation tool. Where does it get it right, and where does it get it wrong? Using demos, we learn about Power View whilst assessing it based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles by luminaries such as Stephen Few, Tufte and others. We will:

- investigate Power View based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles
- look at the features of Power View
- look at where Power View is supplemented by other parts of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack

Come to this session if you really want to think about the best ways of presenting data to your Business Intelligence data consumers, and see how to apply these principles in Power View.</description>

      <title>The Power of Custom Assemblies in Analysis Service</title>
      <description>Sometimes you are stuck with customer demands where common solutions just aren't scalable
within the Analysis Services (SSAS) regular toolbox. This is where custom
assemblies come to save the day!  Custom assemblies allow you to extend
the power of SSAS by using other technologies, as in this case T-SQL and the
SQL Server relational engine.

This session will demonstrate how to utilize custom assemblies in Analysis Services to leverage the
power of the relational engine and use it directly in MDX. Through the .Net
framework and T-SQL we will be able to inject dimension member unique names
into MDX. Effectively we are replacing the MDX Crossjoins with the T-SQL Inner
joins, whereby gaining scalability and consistency in query perfo</description>

      <title>Getting SQL Service Broker Up and Running</title>
      <description>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 include a fantastic feature that few people understand or use.  That feature is the Microsoft SQL Server Service Broker.  The SQL Service Broker is one of the least used features within the database engine, and that lack of use is simply from last of knowledge about the feature.

In this session we’ll dig into how to configure the service broker for not only intra-database message queuing, but database to database queuing as well as server to server database queuing.  We will also dig into a real life scenario where the SQL Server Service Broker was used to do ETL from an OLTP database to an OLAP database in near real time for near real time reporting (as time allows).</description>

      <description>Sometimes you really need an EAV model. In most cases they are ugly and slow.
After this session you will have gained new insights how to turn your old, slow, EAV model into a slim superfast model.

There will be real life examples from a recent project. With the techniques displayed in the presentation, I cut the execution time down from 134 days down to 0.5 seconds and cut the storage need from 550GB to 45GB.

But I keep running into weird requests that were just easier to fix with Powershell.
I'll show you why some things are not easy in SSIS. 
I'll also discuss how you can work around a lot of that instead of switching to Powershell like I did.
This session will be around 70% "why is this hard in SSIS and can you work around it?"  and 30% "Look how cool Powershell is"</description>

In a session that tackles several internals storage issues, needed to fulfill its objective, we will go in a travel that starts by the end of the log and will, hopefully, only end at the birth of the database.</description>

      <title>Storing Character Data Optimally</title>
      <description>So you need to store character data in your database? Easy enough, you just create an nvarchar(MAX) field and you're done, right? It turns out, it's not so simple. First up you need to decide on a data type - should you use text? Char(100)? Varchar(100)? Or perhaps one of the (MAX) types? I'll go through the options we have, including a deep dive on how each data type differs in its storage on disk. Knowing this, we can make intelligent decisions on which type to use, as well as predicting actual performance implications. Knowing how to store character data optimally is an absolutely critical part of your job as a DBA.</description>

      <title>SQLServer2012 as semantic search engine</title>
      <description>With the increase in the number of documents created, received and stored by computer, consequently increases the difficulty and time to retrieve these documents based on their content and meaning. With SQL Server 2012 and its new features of Filestream and FullText engine, it is possible to go beyond the "classical" management of key words and phrases linked to each document. Thanks to semantic search you can search for documents according to their meaning, find related documents and retrieve similar documents easily and effectively.</description>

      <title>Decisions, Decisions...</title>
      <description>Decision-trees are the bread-and-butter of predictive modeling. Conceptually simple, fast to build and easy to interpret - yet quite powerful and versatile. They come in many flavors, from the smallest tree to vast (random) forests
This session will explain the basics of decision trees and demonstrate the process of building, interpreting, tuning, pruning and validating a simple model using the Data Mining components of SQL Server Analysis Services.

      <title>SQL anti patterns</title>
      <description>You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.</description>

      <title>Accelerating SQL 2012 Clustering with NAND Flash</title>
      <description>A DBA running SQL Server 2008 or above will often think he has no alternative to shared storage in order to run High availability Clustering in terms of both performance as well High Availability. Understand if it is worth trading high latency Shared Storage with low Price/GB to Local, Low latency OS integrated NAND Flash with high price/GB by trading Host Memory and CPU cycles for I/O Using NAND Flash from Fusion-io  Also, is there a potential License saving by running lower latency I/O and reducing CPU count?</description>
