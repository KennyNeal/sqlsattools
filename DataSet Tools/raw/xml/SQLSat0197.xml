      <description>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

      <title>Hardware 201: Selecting Database Hardware</title>
      <description>The foundation of database performance is the underlying server hardware and storage subsystem. Even the best designed and optimized database application can be crippled by an inadequate hardware and storage infrastructure. Recent advances in new processors and chipsets, along with improvements in magnetic and SSD storage have dramatically changed the evaluation and selection process compared to the past. Many database professionals struggle to keep up with new technology and often simply let someone else make their hardware selection and sizing decisions. Don't let this happen to you! This session covers current and upcoming hardware from both Intel and AMD.</description>

      <description>SQL Server 2005 and later continued to introduce tools to help you audit what was occurring in your database, with 2012 introducing even more auditing tools.  In this session, we'll go over the questions you need to ask your business to determine what level of auditing is appropriate.  We'll go through how to set up many of the common audits to meet your business' requirements.   Each technique has its features and each has associated costs - your goal is to find a balance.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting Query Plan Quality Issues</title>
      <description>When the query optimizer inaccurately estimates the number of rows for query execution plan iterators, performance can suffer due to the generation and use of a suboptimal plan. Fixing cardinality estimate issues will help the query optimizer generate a higher quality plan. This session will teach you how to identify cardinality estimate issues in your query execution plan and also cover various ways in which cardinality estimate issues can be addressed.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Modelling for the DBA</title>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what's going on with that SQL Server Analysis server you support? Do you want to know what this
BI fuss is all about?  I'll walk you through the basics of dimensional modelling to help you understand from a operational
DBA perspective what's going on and why a BI system needs to be treated differently. I'll take the mysticism out of the 
differences between OLTP and OLAP and provide a method to the maddness. </description>

Using Crystal disk mark, SQLIO, Memtest86, and Dell DVDstore tools to measure, baseline and compare results of your new hardware.  Crystal disk mark and SQLIO will test IO subsystems ; memtest86 will test your memory before you put it into production.  Dell DVDstore will be used to create a database enabling you to put a synthetic load simulating numerous users to your SQL server instance, enabling the creation of solid baselines when putting the server under a heavy load.  Using the benchmarks to determine capacity of the hardware and will it met the expected load.</description>

These can be images, audio files, video, or even common formats like Word and Excel files. This data contains lots of important data, but the formatting must be stripped out in order for users to effectively search this data. Filestream, Filetable, Full-Text Search, and Semantic Search are covered.</description>

In this session will highlight the differences between traditional OLAP and tabular models and reasons for selecting one approach over another. I will demonstrate how to create a data model first in power pivot model and then import into an Analysis Services Tabular Project.  Working with the imported data I will then create measures, KPIs, perspectives, and implement security. Finally I will deploy the model to an Analysis Server.</description>

      <title>Dr. DMV: How to Use Dynamic Management Views</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2005 introduced Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) that allow you to see exactly what is happening inside your SQL Server instances and databases with much more detail than ever before. SQL Server 2008 R2 adds even more capability in this area. You can discover your top wait types, most CPU intensive stored procedures, find missing indexes, and identify unused indexes, to name just a few examples. This session (which is applicable to SQL Server 2005 through 2012), presents and explains over fifty DMV queries that you can quickly and easily use to detect and diagnose performance issues in your environment.
