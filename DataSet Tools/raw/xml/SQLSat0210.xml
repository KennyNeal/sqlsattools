      <title>Self-Service Business Analytics in 2013</title>
      <description>In this session, I make the case for Self-Service Analytics as one part of a broader reporting and analytics strategy. On its own, Self-Service Analytics struggles to deliver business users the insights they need, but when combined with a corporate BI platform, the power of Self-Service Analytics shines, and the often toxic relationship between the IT department and the Business changes to one of mutual respect and working together to achieve common goals. After laying the foundations, we'll launch into a range of demos covering PerformancePoint dashboards, SSRS Report Alerts, Report Builder Report Parts, Power View, Pivot  PowerPivot. All demos will show how corporate BI solutions can be extended and enhanced with Self-Service Analytics.</description>

      <title>Achieving Infinite Scale with HDInsight</title>
      <description>The traditional approach to database scalability has been to simply buy a bigger box. However with the ongoing data explosion that is occurring in organisations today there is a need to re-think how to achieve scalability for the database platform. In this session we will explore how to extend the scalability of Microsoft SQL Server by using HDInsight and how to achieve scalability as a Hybrid solution using the Azure platform. With nothing more than a credit card and the Azure platform you will see how it is now possible to create highly-available, infinitely scalable SQL Server environments that support automated deployment and elastic scale. </description>

      <title>Introducing Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel</title>
      <description>In this session, I will introduce the audience to Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel. "Data Explorer" is an Excel add-in that enhances the self-service Business Intelligence experience in Excel by simplifying data discovery and access. It has often been referred to as the end-user ETL tool, but I believe that it will also be a valuable tool for all technical staff. This demo rich presentation will expose many great features of the newest addition to the Microsoft self-service offering.</description>

      <description>In this fast paced world there is an ever increasing need to squeeze extra performance out of your SQL Server environment.
