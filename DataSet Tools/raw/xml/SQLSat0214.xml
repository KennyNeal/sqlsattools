      <description>Mickey Stuewe has been working with SQL Server since 6.5. That gives her over 20 years of experience. She has not only been a database developer, but also an application developer, even before Visual Studio existed. She is now thankful to be focusing on database design, t-SQL development, and query optimization. She also has a habit of enjoying SSIS and data warehouse design.

She blogs regularly on her website mickeystuewe.com and contributes to sites such as SQL Server Central and SQL Server Pro. She enjoys presenting at PASS Summit, SQL Saturdays, User Groups and other events.

When she is not immersed in SQL related activities, she enjoys action movies, art, reading, and laughing. She laughs loudly and often...just ask her children.</description>

      <title>TFS for SQL/BI Developers</title>
      <description>If you do any kind of SQL Server or BI development, you eventually have to grapple with the problem of keeping multiple copies of your work.  You either need to maintain stored procedure and DDL scripts or you have copies of SSIS and SSRS reports to keep up with.  In most cases, this problem starts off small as you need to have development versus production copies of your code.  But eventually, it becomes harder and harder to maintain your "source code" as your environment becomes more complex and as you potentially have to start working with a team of other developers.  During this session, we'll talk about Team Foundation Server (TFS) and show you the different ways it can be used to keep up with all the different types of source code you might be responsible for -- from full database designs to complete BI solutions.</description>

      <title>Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server</title>
      <description>SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.</description>

      <title>Become a SQL Block’stroyer</title>
      <description>In order to implement ACID properties, SQL Server uses locks to control who can have access to what resources. In this session we will discuss how to leverage the different isolation levels within SQL Server to affect locking behavior. Before taking a deep dive into how to detect, mitigate, and possibly eliminate certain types of blocking in the system, we will explore some of the basic lock types and how they interact. Once we have learned how to deal with classic blocks in this fast paced demo filled session, we will explore several real world strategies to mitigate the dreaded deadlock. Be prepared to enter this session as a DBA but leave as a SQL Block’stroyer!</description>

      <title>Add It Up: Analysis Services Aggregations</title>
      <description>Are you looking to maximize the performance of your Analysis Services queries? This session explains what aggregations are and how they work. You’ll learn how to create aggregations, tune the aggregations based on actual usage, and design custom aggregations when necessary. You’ll discover the benefits and pitfalls of flexible aggregations, when to use rigid aggregations, and the meaning of lazy aggregation processing. You’ll dive into queries to see if aggregations are being used and learn when aggregations aren’t useful. If you thought aggregation design began and ended with the aggregation wizard, you owe it to yourself (and your cubes) to attend this session.</description>

      <title>Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables</title>
      <description>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the XML source</title>
      <description>XML is all over the place.  But how do you get that data into SQL Server?  SSIS provides an XML Source, but it is not easy to use.  In this session we will handle increasingly complex XML documents.  After an introduction to using the XML Source with a single set of elements, we will look at how to work with multiple element sets.  This includes hierarchically structured XML documents.

Attendees will be able to import simple XML using SSIS.  They will be able to create import routines that pull data from different elements of more complex XML.  They will understand the role the XML Schema plays in defining the XML data they import.

Learn how to get the most out of the Tablix controls in this demo-heavy session. We'll go through how to best layout data using multiple Tablix controls. We’ll use parameters to change the layout of the data in these controls to minimize the number of reports that need to be maintained. We’ll create a columnar report that grows vertically as well as horizontally, and we’ll find out about other exciting uses of this highly flexible control.</description>

      <title>Through Gardens Overgrown: PowerPivot to SSAS 2012Tabular</title>
      <description>In this presentation, Analysis Services Maestro and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson overviews the steps required to “upgrade” an Excel PowerPivot model to an SSAS 2012 Tabular model using SQL Server Data Tools (“SSDT”).  We’ll discuss motivations behind moving to SSAS 2012 Tabular, including PowerPivot model size challenges for the client environment, both from the perspective of processing and querying optimization.  We will then undertake a walkthrough of the steps required to convert a model designed in PowerPivot to a server - level Tabular model.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous programming with Service Broker</title>
      <description>In this session we will explore Service Broker, one of the lesser known features available since Microsoft SQL Server 2005. This technology provides a robust asynchronous programming model and can be reliably used to develop lightning fast applications that scale very well and can boost your application's throughput. We will look at a few examples of real world service broker implementations in OLTP as well as batch processing modes. We will also discuss some of the commonly used tools for troubleshooting a service broker set up, as well as some few to avoid common pitfalls.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>Introduction to SQL Server 2012 AlwaysOn Availability Groups</title>
      <description>One of the most talked about new features in SQL Server 2012 is AlwaysOn Availability Groups. In this session, we will cover the pros and cons of using Availability Groups as well as the basics of how to set them up and take advantage of readable secondary replicas. If you want to improve the availability and performance of your applications  databases, are currently using Database Mirroring, or if you're just curious about Availability Groups, then you won't want to miss this session.</description>

      <title>Transaction Log Internals</title>
      <description>The transaction log is the most important aspect of a SQL Server database. Separating the data and log files is usually good advice, but there is so much more about the transaction log that is misunderstood. Join Microsoft Premier Field Engineer Tim Chapman as he discusses data modification internals, write-ahead logging and the inner workings of the SQL Server transaction log.

      <title>Understanding Transaction Isolation Levels</title>
      <description>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.
