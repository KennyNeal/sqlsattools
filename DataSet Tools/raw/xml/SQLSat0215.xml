      <title>Principles of BISM Tabular Modeling</title>
      <description>Although BISM Tabular is a powerful analytical engine that can efficiently link data across multiple sources, it is common to get stuck when attempting to connect tables and generate calculations to leverage all sources in a single model.  Many issues regularly encountered by BI developers (and data analysts when using PowerPivot) can be attributed to violations of one or more of the relationship rules of the Tabular engine. It is necessary to understand those rules in order to handle increasingly complex semantic modeling requirements.

On this session, attendees will gain an understanding of the fundamental principles which must be followed to develop effective models in BISM Tabular as well as PowerPivot.

      <title>Putting Quality Back Into Your Data</title>
      <description>This session introduces Data Quality Services, a new feature of SQL Server 2012.  One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication.  Sometimes you even need to consolidate data from more than one source that may have different standards and format.  Microsoft’s solution in SQL 2012 is Data Quality Services (DQS).  In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data.  I will end the session with a set of demonstration of how DQS works with different data problems to help you put quality back into your data.</description>

      <description>In this age of big data, location matters more than many people imagine. Almost every set of data has some geographic information tied to it, and it is all the more pertinent to understand and unravel the patterns and trends behind them. This session will start by explaining why GeoSpatial analytics is important in today's world and then continue by exploring how we can share, analyze, and visualize data using the comprehensive Microsoft BI toolset, including Power View, GeoFlow, SQL Server Reporting Services, and more. The session will also feature practical demos for each of these tools, during which we will work on some of the publicly available datasets to uncover some interesting facts.</description>

      <description>The more you know about SQL Server the more you understand how it works.  SQL Server is a product we use every day, and most of us know the big concepts.  At the 10,000 foot view we know what  Databases, Tables, and Columns are.   But what makes up those Databases, Tables, and Columns.  What are Records, Pages, Extents, and Allocation Units?  What are Full, Simple, and Bulk-Logged Recovery?  What are the differences between  Full, Transaction Log, Differential, or Filegroup backups?  This is an introduction to these concepts.  In this session you will learn about the internal Structure, Recovery Modes, and Backups and be better prepared to for Future Learning and Managing SQL!</description>

      <description>Every company has a backup strategy.  That backup strategy is worthless and will cause your business to fail miserably while losing valuable customer data, protected HIPAA information, and MY social security number.  Because of that, Peggy will be bankrupting my credit report. In this session you will learn: what is a recovery strategy,
creating your recovery point and recovery time objectives, selecting the proper backup type and recovery model, and then we will be putting it all together into a winning strategy!

      <title>Extend Your Knowledge with Extended Events!</title>
      <description>SQL Server Extended Events can be used to gather a wide range of performance information, and in troubleshooting in SQL Server.  Extended Events use less system resources and provide better information than SQL Profiler and they allow for correlation of SQL Server event data along side of OS or Application event data. This presentation will explore what Extended Events are, how to set them up and use them in several case studies.

      <title>Database Projects - An Introduction</title>
      <description>Database projects have come a long way since the first fumbling attempts.  The newest incarnation is SSDT (Sql Server Development Tools) and it has left behind the false errors and obtuse directory hierarchy of database projects past.  Database projects have finally evolved to where they can be integrated into your daily build cycle!  I know, I know, I was skeptical too; and I don't mean to disillusion you into thinking it will all work fine right out of the box -- no, we're not close to there yet! Come to this session and let me introduce you to the strengths, weaknesses, caveats, and workarounds of database projects.</description>
