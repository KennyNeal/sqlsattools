      <title>5 Query Plan Culprits That Cause 95% of Headaches</title>
      <description>Ever open a huge query plan to track down a performance issue and find yourself overwhelmed by the number of objects on the screen? How do you figure out which part of the plan is causing the problem? What should you do about it? The vast majority of query plan troubles boil down to the same basic causes; solving them is simply a matter of knowing where to look. In this session you will learn how to open a plan and drill in to the most likely problem areas. Once there, a simple analysis of five key indicators will help you diagnose your performance problem faster than you thought possible. Say goodbye to guesswork and game playing. This session will teach you how easy it can be to apply a bit of logic to improve performance of your queries.</description>

      <title>Storage Tuning Deep Dive</title>
      <description>In this talk we will look at squeezing the maximum out of your storage systems. We will work on  a live system testing concepts like short-stroking for performance. We will also show how some of these techniques are still valid on systems with SSD’s in the mix. We will cover some basics you need to know then dive into configuring local disk systems and how to test them to measure the gains or loses. This session is geared to the DBA who has a working knowledge of storage and how SQL Server works with the file system.

Takeaways:
1.	How to configure spinning disk for maximum IO or maximum throughput
2.	How to keep your SSD’s from suffering the write cliff and keep performance strong
3.	Using the DVD Store 2 benchmark to test with SQL Server installed
4.	Using ioMeter to test disks directly

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

      <title>GeoSpatial Analytics Using Microsoft BI</title>
      <description>In this age of big data, location matters more than many people imagine. Almost every set of data has some geographic information tied to it, and it is all the more pertinent to understand and unravel the patterns and trends behind them. This session will start by explaining why GeoSpatial analytics is important in today's world and then continue by exploring how we can share, analyze, and visualize data using the comprehensive Microsoft BI toolset, including Power View, GeoFlow, SQL Server Reporting Services, and more. The session will also feature practical demos for each of these tools, during which we will work on some of the publicly available datasets to uncover some interesting facts.</description>

      <description>Do you listen to podcasts? It's like the radio, but more Internetty. Well, Atlanta just so happens to be the home to the two co-hosts of the PowerScripting Podcast, the first podcast devoted to talking about Windows PowerShell. We have news, interviews, tips and resources that we present every week at powerscripting.net, but this time, the show is coming to you live! We'll come prepared to hit most any general PowerShell topic you want, and we'll probably sneak some SQL + PowerShell experts on stage to help out. This won't be a canned lecture, it will be more of a Birds of a Feather or talk show feel. Audience participation is REQUIRED!</description>

      <title>Automating SSIS Development with Biml</title>
      <description>SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.</description>

      <title>Taming Complex Tasks with the Psake Module</title>
      <description>PSake is a PowerShell module that helps you work with a tree of interdependent tasks.  Originally designed for software builds, the simple workflow-as-tasks model lends itself to solving many other complex problems, such as VM provisioning, database setup and migration, even installing software.

In this session we will explore the PSake module, specifically learning how we can use the module to make small work out of a versioned SQL database migration.  You will learn how to translate a complex problem into a set of reusable and interrelated tasks, how to make your tasks discoverable, and how to manage large numbers of tasks in your workflow.</description>

      <description>A Dynamic Dialog session: According to research compiled by Gartner from discussions with many BI clients, a substantial disparity exists, in the implementation of BI, between theory (standard approaches, promises, claims and expectations) and practice (shortfalls, compromises and other realities). In this session, Business Intelligence Architect and Microsoft MVP Bill Pearson leads a dialog within which we gain an understanding of the general types of discrepancies between the “ideal” approach to BI and the compromised reality that a large number of organizations experience. We’ll then share and class experiences as a group, and discuss ways to avoid these discrepancies in future projects.</description>

      <title>Taking BI to the Next Level: Collaboration</title>
      <description>Self-service BI is usually an independent activity. But when individuals discover interesting information that they want to share, they need a centralized location to do that. When people work together, new insights are possible, and that’s what collaboration is all about. As more people see the benefits of the solution, they become more likely to use it. As individual products, SQL Server 2008 R2, SharePoint 2010, and Excel 2010 expand your options for enabling BI in your organization, but collectively they create a solid platform for collaborative BI. Knowing which tool to use for which job can be tricky. Come to this session to learn how to use these tools to foster collaboration.</description>

      <description>SQL Server Data Tools is an evolving product.  Besides revamping database projects this product has also changed the lifecycle in which we receive new features.  In this session we will demonstrate features such as database snapshots, localdb, and database unit testing.

Most importantly we’ll show the many benefits of the Publish feature, and why you will want to use the built-in refactoring instead of just renaming objects.  Throughout this presentation we will also highlight and demonstrate the features that have been added to SSDT in the past year.

      <title>Applied Enterprise Semantic Mining</title>
      <description>Text mining is projected to dominate data mining, and the reasons are evident:  we have more text available than numeric data.  Microsoft introduced a new technology to SQL Server 2012 called Semantic Search. This session's detailed description and demos give you important information for the enterprise implementation of Tag Index and Document Similarity Index. The demos include a web-based Silverlight application, and content documents from Wikipedia. We'll also look at strategy tips for how to best leverage the new semantic technology with existing Microsoft data mining.</description>

      <title>The Last Mile:  Dynamically Created Objects</title>
      <description>Squeezing the last bit of performance out of you application after you have refactored your SQL and tuned your server and indexes can be frustrating.  Making it more difficult might be the requirement to keep a single code base for each user and company that can configure your application to work specifically for them.  One possible solution is tailoring programmable objects to each user.  It will provide SQL specific to the user's needs thereby ensuring they the best possible performance based on their configuration.</description>

      <description>The session explains Attributes and Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012 Semantic Model. They are used to slice (filter) and dice (group) measures and dimensions used to view analytical data.  The slicing and dicing of data involves fields, columns, or whatever you want to labeled them. But, in SQL Server Semantic model these are called Attributes and Hierarchies. The configuration of these slicers and dicers are important in SQL Server Analysis Services. This session will demonstrate the difference between an attribute and columns in a hierarchy in the dimension as well as the configuration of these for best performance and viewing.

      <title>SQL Database (Windows Azure)</title>
      <description>SQL Database is part of the Windows Azure platform: a suite of services providing hosted computing, infrastructure, Web services, Reporting services and data services. The SQL Database component provides the relational database functionality of SQL Server, but it also provides functionality as a cloud-computing service, hosted in Microsoft data-centers around the globe. We will go over how it works and what it has to offer, as well as some of the differences and limitations.

***It is assumed that you have familiarity with SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Storage for the DBA</title>
      <description>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</description>

      <title>Working with "Biggish Data"</title>
      <description>Most database professionals know (from firsthand experience) that there continues to be a "data explosion", and there's been a lot of focus lately on "big data".  But what do you do when your data's just kind of "biggish"?  You're managing Terabytes, not Petabytes, and you're trying to squeeze out as much performance out of your aging servers as possible.  The focus of this session is to identify some key guidelines for the design, management, and ongoing optimization of "larger-than-average" databases. Special attention will be paid to the following areas: * query design * logical and physical data structures * maintenance  backup strategies </description>

      <title>T-SQL: Beyond the Basics</title>
      <description>If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language.  Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply?  In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.</description>
