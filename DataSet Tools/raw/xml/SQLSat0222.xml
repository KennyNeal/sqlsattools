      <title>Master Data and Data Quality in SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>A recent survey by Information Week found that data quality is the greatest barrier to BI adoption in enterprises.  MDS addresses this challenge with modeling, validation, alerting and security capabilities.  In this presentation, you will learn how to use MDS to model your data to ensure correctness, update it with changes from your ERP, and create workflows with notifications.  Next you will learn the capabilities of DQS and see how it addresses data standardization, completeness and other challenges.  You will then see how to use them together to enable Enterprise Information Management.  BI professionals will come away with knowledge on how to use tools that address the greatest risk to success for BI projects - data quality.</description>

      <title>Detect Worst Performing SQL Queries During Peak Hour</title>
      <description>How many times you have been thrown in a situation when you have been asked to fix performance issues of a database system which you have never seen before? Where do you start tuning? When do you stop tuning? Each application is different. With the ever increasing number of systems one production DBA has to manage today, it's very important to use TOP to BOTTOM approach to troubleshoot performance issues, which will lead to the answers in the right way for the application under consideration. 

While you can find top queries, wouldn't it be awesome if you can find out which ones are the exact queries taking most of the resources in last hour and current situation? Now you can focus on those specific queries!

In this session, Prakash walks you through with scenario  demos to find which exact queries are taxing production systems resources based on CPU/DISK/Memory/Network. They are all based on his own real-life experience from managing demanding database systems.</description>

      <title>SQL Server encryption 3 ways - in transit, at rest and in the database</title>
      <description>Dude, where's my keys??!?!

Confused about the various ways SQL Server handles encryption? Tasked with securing your environment or trying to pass an audit? There's a lot of information that can be difficult to wade through. In this session, I'll go over three ways to encrypt SQL Server, showing practical examples of the various techniques. We'll look at encrypting the information at the network level (in transit), encrypting the data and backup files (at rest using Transparent Data Encryption) and encryption of sensitive information in the database (columns and stored procedures). 

This will be a high level, hands-on discussion that will enable any administrator to put the techniques discussed into practice immediately.  You'll see how encryption will fit into your overall security scheme.</description>

      <title>SMO Internals for High Performance PowerShell</title>
      <description>Ever wanted to know what happens in SQL Server when you use PowerShell and SMO to manage a SQL Server?  How fast can your automation really go? I will take you through the most common objects in SMO and the internals of what happens when you use those objects. We will examine the TSQL that is generated, and learn techniques that lead to high efficiency.  We will dive deep through the collections that make SMO the powerful tool it is. Combining the flexibility of PowerShell and SMO Internals is a recipe for awesome sauce.  Come peek behing the curtain and squeeze the speed out of your automation scripts using PowerShell and SMO.  You'll be glad you did.</description>

      <title>It's All About the Performance, Right?</title>
      <description>Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working. But, it is not running close to efficient, and as the workloads grow, it will only get worse. This session by David Klee (@kleegeek) provides valuable details on how to tweak and tune your SQL Server installations to ensure maximum performance, as well as tips on capacity management so you know when you need to add more hardware to take your server to the next level.</description>

      <title>5 Ways SSIS 2012 can Save You Time and Money</title>
      <description>Integration Services in SQL Server 2012 gives DBAs and BI developers new features that save time and money in terms of development and management. Whether you're automating DBA tasks, ETL processes, or System Integrations, SSIS has something for everyone. 

Come learn about:

-Improvements in the design interface 
-SSIS Parameters 
-Easier Deployment with the SSIS Catalog 
-New Standard Reports for monitoring SSIS 
-New ways to control SSIS on the server. 

If you're on SQL Server 2008, not to worry. I will show you an additional 3rd party tool that gives you a lot of this functionality. But nothing beats the ROI with SSIS 2012.</description>

SQL Server Databaseology 201 is the science concerned with the study of SQL Server databases and their structures.  This session will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server databases. The attendee will walk away with a deeper understanding of how SQL Server databases work which would allow them to build better and faster databases.  </description>

      <title>Searching Binary Data in SQL Server 2012</title>
      <description>More and more data collected in organizations is in an encoded format, essentially a binary classification of data. These can be images, audio files, video, or even common formats like Word and Excel files. This data contains lots of important data, but the formatting must be stripped out in order for users to effectively search this data. Filestream, Filetable, Full-Text Search, and Semantic Search are covered.</description>

      <title>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</title>
      <description>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.</description>

You will see how to use SQL Server features such as replication, Change Data Capture, SSIS, and other techniques to extract, transform, and load data fast and dependably. We will develop an actual sample system during the session and discuss and walk through alternative real-time architectures. We will then see how to use Reporting Services to present data with a minimum amount of latency.</description>

      <title>What Happened? Exploring the Plan Cache</title>
      <description>If you haven't been pro-active and set up some sort of tracing, does that mean there is nothing you can do to find out what problematic queries might be running? The answer is no. 

In this session, we'll explore SQL Server's plan cache, from the way it is managed in memory, to the tools and techniques for discovering what plans are in cache, how long they've been there, how often they've been run, and whether they contain any suspected sub-optimal operators, such as table scans and hash joins. Knowing what's happened is the first step in knowing what needs to be fixed.
