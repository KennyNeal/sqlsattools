      <title>Introducing Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel</title>
      <description>In this session, I will introduce the audience to Microsoft Data Explorer for Excel. "Data Explorer" is an Excel add-in that enhances the self-service Business Intelligence experience in Excel by simplifying data discovery and access. It has often been referred to as the end-user ETL tool, but I believe that it will also be a valuable tool for all technical staff. This demo rich presentation will expose many great features of the newest addition to the Microsoft self-service offering.</description>

      <title>Maximizing SQL Server Performance: Tuning the Processor, RAM, Disk and Network Subsystems</title>
      <description>You can't escape hardware or the laws of physics. Ultimately your SQL Server instance will be using the processor, memory, disk and network subsystems. In this session Victor Isakov (MCA, MCM, MCT, MVP) will go through the various subsystems and examine how the SQL Server database engine works with them and what configuration options exist. Along the way he will discuss how to tune the hardware, operating system and SQL Server for maximal performance.</description>

      <title>Mastering the CUBE functions in Excel 2013</title>
      <description>This session explores the seven CUBE functions that are natively available in Excel 2013. Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.

The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.

This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is also applicable to Excel 2007 and Excel 2010.</description>
