      <title>The Secret Life of APPLY: Helping Developers Work Smarter, Not Harder</title>
      <description>At the very least, a T-SQL developer should know that the APPLY operator lets you access data from a table-valued function in a dynamic manner.  But why stop there? When getting the data you need requires going around your elbow to get to your nose, that's when the savvy developer remembers the APPLY operator can be used with any table expression. Have you ever wished you could get multiple columns or multiple rows from a correlated sub-query? What about needing to UNPIVOT a data set, or parse some XML code? Have you simply wanted to find a way to handle complex calculations without having to cut and paste the entire formula in the WHERE or GROUP BY clause? This all-demo session answers those needs by revealing the secret life of APPLY, and helping you count yourself among those ace developers that use this handy operator to work smarter, not harder.</description>

      <title>Data Architectural Patterns in C#</title>
      <description>This session will present the following topics:
(1) Data architectural patterns that can be implemented in a modern Software Architecture for favoring non-functional requirements such as resource management (concurrency, even distribution) and resource demand (incremental caching, hash partitions).
(2) Design techniques (like Resource Pooling, Do Not Wait / Fire and Forget , preferred caching components) and principles (like Eventual consistency, CAP theorem, Fine grained vs coased grained, Statelessness, Idempotency and fallacy of zero latency) to improve the application performance in the data access layer.

This session is for Software Developers/Designers/Architects and Data Architects interested in exploring the available options</description>

      <title>SQL Azure from Plan, to Backup, to Cloud </title>
      <description>Microsoft released SQL Azure more than two years ago - that's enough time for testing (I hope!). So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (i.e. a production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for backing up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually, restoring with Red Gate Cloud Services. In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionality, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012. We’ll consider topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.

      <title>Data Visualisation with Hadoop Mashups, Power View and Excel 2013</title>
      <description>The Hadoop ecosystem is a valuable tool for Business Intelligence and Data Visualisation practitioners. It allows you to mashup unstructured data from Hadoop with structured data from more traditional relational and multi-dimensional sources. For Business Intelligence practitioners, this is an excellent tool to gain new business insights, and overcome data silos that come from within the organisation, whilst freeing you to make use of external data sources too.
Join us at this session in order to see how your Big Data can empower your business users via familiar Business Intelligence tools such as Excel and Power View.</description>

      <title>Cats, Facebook, and Online Dating with Microsoft BI</title>
      <description>The BI Power Hour is a popular session at the PASS Summit and TechEd conferences that shows off the power and versatility of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack through demos that contain little to no real world business value. Unlike most technical sessions at these conferences, the goal of the Power Hour is to entertain rather than educate. Any learning the audience experiences is purely accidental. For the past three years I’ve been a Power Hour presenter and have put together a number of demos that use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in non-standard ways. This session will take a look at these demos, show how they were built, and talk about some of the key things I’ve learned while putting them together.</description>

      <title>SQL Server and XML Query</title>
      <description>XML was added to the collection of SQL Server native data types in SQL Server 2005. Being a complex data type, not only is XML accompanied by a set of dedicated T-SQL functions, but also with a complete querying language. In this session you will learn about the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 implementation of the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Query Recommendation, and learn how to compose XML data – from existing SQL Server data or simply "from scratch", how to retrieve (relational) data from XML Documents to be used in a SQL Server database, and how to manipulate XML data using Transact-SQL and the XML Data Manipulation Language (XML DML). You've already mastered all the primitive SQL Server data types, why would XML be an exception?</description>

      <title>Hadoop for the Microsoft Guy</title>
      <description>Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.

      <title>Getting the most from your SAN - File and Filegroup design patterns</title>
      <description>You’ve been given the task of optimising the File and Filegroup layout to get the most from your storage. Not sure where to start, or thinking you could get a more from your storage with a different design?

Are your SAN guys telling you your storage can process 2 GB/s but you're only seeing 200 MB/s?

This session will dive into how to optimise your File and Filegroup layout strategy to get the most from your I/O Subsytem, including a case study where we took a customer's table scans from 500 MB/s to 1.2 GB/s with only a change in filegroup layout.

Topics covered include:
- Layout for OLTP
- Data Warehousing Fast Track Style
- Data Warehousing on a SAN
- Get data into your SSAS cubes faster (ProcessData)
- Hidden options and “go faster” buttons 
- How to maximise performance in enterprise edition and master read ahead

      <title>SQL Server Data platform upgrade Techniques, best practices  notes from the field</title>
      <description>Why Upgrade?
This is the big question that every SQL Server user will be asking, from my experience I say not just for shiny new features but increase your productivity and do-more with-less practices.
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits.
In this session, we will overview end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading SQL Server 2000, 2005,  SQL Server 2008 R2 (with a good overview on 2012 too) by using best practices and available resources. We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution is offered.</description>

      <title>Dos and don’ts of database corruption</title>
      <description>Database corruption is one of the worst things you can encounter as a DBA. It can result in downtime, data loss, and unhappy users. What’s scary about corruption is that it can strike out of the blue and with no warning, and without having some 
In this session we’ll look at
•	Easy maintenance operations you should be running right now to ensure the fastest possible identification and resolution of corruption
•	Best practices for handling a database that you suspect may be corrupted
•	Actions that can worsen the problem
•	Appropriate steps to take and methods of recovery

      <title>Dynamic code for efficient searching </title>
      <description>Illustrate how multipurpose queries can lead to issues with scalability and performance. Show a few alternatives that will work for smaller and simpler queries while highlighting their limitations for more complex queries. Then work through building a dynamic search query to resolve the identified performance issues. Touching on: • Testing. • Tuning each part of the query in isolation. • Plan cache re-use • Security – SQL injection attacks and authorisation / code signing. • Possibly, mentioning greater re-use and extendibility.</description>

      <title>Optimising a dot.net solution on the SQL platform</title>
      <description>In this case study we will take a sample dot.net ecommerce application running in a load test harness and show common performance worst practices, how to correct them and the impact on performance. During a series of live demos we aim to test just how far we can optimise transactional processing.This session is aimed to help developers and DBA’s understand the performance impact of choices made within a dot.net application and its interaction with SQL Server.</description>

      <title>T-SQL : Bad Habits  Best Practices</title>
      <description>Bad habits: we all have them. SELECT * is the obvious one; but in this session you will learn about various other habits and why they can be bad for performance or maintainability. You will also learn about best practices that will help you avoid falling into some of these bad habits. Come learn how these habits develop, what kind of problems they can lead to, and how you can avoid them - leading to more efficient code, a more productive work environment, and - in a lot of cases – both.</description>

      <title>Query Plans Deep Dive</title>
      <description>In this session we will take an in depth look at how query plans work. We will go under the covers and see what happens when you run that query. 
We will also take a look at various operators, how they work, why they are chosen and how to avoid them being used in the wrong place / context,.
Attendees of this session will walk away with a greater understanding of query plans and the operators, which will enable them to both better interpret their query plans and also write more efficient SQL code</description>

      <title>READPAST  Furious-Transactions,LockingIsolation</title>
      <description>Do you really understand SQL Servers’ Concurrency behaviour?
Are you sure that Transactions are an ALL or NOTHING operation?
Do you believe Read operations cannot start a Transaction?
Do you really know if READ UNCOMMITTED is safe for reporting?
Is being Optimistic really better than being Pessimistic?
Can SQL Server 2012 be the solution to all our problems or our worst nightmare?

I look forward to you joining me in this very revealing and thought provoking session where I will provide answers to all these questions and more and make you wish you had known all of this sooner.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2012 Memory Management</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2012 brings a wide range of changes from its previous versions - one key change is the way SQL Server memory is managed. With releases prior to SQL Server 2012, there were 2 memory managers, these have been merged into 1 with the latest version, and that’s just the start of the changes for SQL Server memory. 
This session will dive into questions related to memory primarily for SQL Server 2012. </description>
