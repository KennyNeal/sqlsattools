      <title>Leveraging PAL for SQL Server Perfmon Analysis</title>
      <description>In this session we will cover the Performance Analysis for Logs (PAL) tool in depth. We will cover the best methods for capturing a .blg capture leveraging PAL to find critical performance area. We will also cover creating your own PAL templates. System Monitor has long been a tool used by system admins, DBAs, and other engineers to get a handle on performance issues in their environment. The tool is powerful, but can be difficult to understand which perfmon counters are valuable, to find the correct counters, and to be able to properly view the output. In this session, we will cover how the PAL tool can be used to produce a rich HTML output of your perfmon capture exposing performance risks and trends with full documentation on what the perf counters means to your given workload. We will cover how to leverage existing PAL templates on SQL Server and other technologies. We will discuss how to adjust existing templates and how to create your own template for performance baselining.</description>

      <title>Exploring The Microsoft Reporting Technologies</title>
      <description>The Microsoft BI Stack provides many different options when it comes to choosing a presentation layer. From PerformancePoint to PowerView the options are plentiful; however each option presents different benefits and is intended for different use cases. In this session I will cover the different presentation options provided by Microsoft and more importantly dive into when and where it is proper to use the different options. I will also demonstrate ways to integrate the different options like including a Reporting Services report in a PerformancePoint dashboard.  </description>

      <title>A Balanced BI Approach (Self-Service  Corporate)</title>
      <description>In this session I will cover how PowerPivot and BISM Tabular complement each other in the domains of self-service and corporate BI. Let's face it, The Finance department does not have the expertise to model a database for reporting, and IT doesn't have the expertise in advanced financial calculations that the executive team is interested in. To bridge the gap from a large requirements process with the risk of functionality lost in translation, I will show you how you can roll out a PowerPivot model for business units in your organization and when it makes sense to centralize it in a BISM Tabular model.</description>
