      <description>For over 15 years Shannon Lowder has been spotting patterns and learning ways to work smarter instead of harder. He started with development and moved into database administration. Using TSQL, Database Jobs and PowerShell, he automated himself out of contracts quickly.  As Business Intelligence became a greater demand, he moved into SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS development.  Early on, he tried using PowerShell and .Net to automate BI Development. Later those efforts turned to Biml.  After founding a startup six years ago, he finds himself a data platform consultant, designing and guiding other professionals to build highly automated enterprise solutions.  Today, he is a Biml Hero candidate and is awaiting the final approval for the award.</description>

      <description>I have spent the last 16 years of my life living, learning and teaching SQL Server.  I am currently a Principal DBA at SAIC, and I teach online DBA courses at BYU-Idaho.   My life before all this was as a high school Drama teacher here in Florida.  It might seem an odd transition, but it really isn't.  To me, part of being a great DBA is embracing the artistry of the process.  How the design of a database ebbs and flows into its final form.  So, I guess you could say I am a SQL artist.</description>

      <description>Database Administrator by day and Author by night Brandie Tarvin sails pirate-populated waters, fights evil robots in disguise and turns kingdoms into chaotic rebellious city-states all while coding ETL processes and protecting real-world data from corruption. If it weren't for her, someone else would have the job and where would be the fun in that?

Brandie's first computer experience was with a State-of-the-Art Commodore 64 brought home by her father, who informed her that "computers are NOT toys" and would not let her use it until she learned how to program. In late 2003, she turned her hobbies of programming, MUSHing and assisting friends with generic tech support into a full time career as a database administrator. She's been stuck in the fabulous and bizarre world of professional IT work ever since.

Currently, Brandie is a Database Administrator  Developer for Allstate Dealer Services in Jacksonville. She has published several articles on SQLServerCentral.com, trains her co-workers in SQL Server, and has previously presented at several SQL Saturday events and JSSUG meetings. She also writes fiction and freelances for Catalyst Game Labs in her spare time.

      <title>Will SQL Server Standard edition meet your needs?</title>
      <description>Working in large Enterprise environments as an employee is a challenge on the best of days. Getting the company to purchase the proper software is I believe a difficult task for even the most seasoned DBAs. Having started at my 3rd large Enterprise I have come to learn that each one manages the purse strings in their own manner. I have always been graced with corporate licenses that allowed me to install Enterprise Editions of SQL Server across the board. I am happy to say that the pendulum has swung and I am now tasked with justifying my SQL Server licenses. This has been a positive event for me that I would like to share with you. This session will share with you some of my current experiences with Standard and Enterprise Editions of SQL Server.  You will be armed with some facts that can help you decide Standard or Enterprise edition so that you can meet the projects objectives, your SLAs and most importantly justify the cost of your SQL Server license. </description>

      <title>Into the Wild,Taming Unstructured Data</title>
      <description>There is runaway growth in the data volumes many organizations are facing today. The bad news is that much of this data is unstructured which means your traditional RDBMS just isn't capability of helping you deal with it. As a result significant emphasis has been put on technologies like Hadoop, No SQL and other distributed databases which are better suited to handling unstructured data. With the latest release SQL Server 2012 however, Microsoft has provided new features which will help tame some of this unstructured data. This session will dive into the new FileTable and Statistical Semantic Search features. We will show you how they work and highlight real world examples for integrating these exciting new features into your organization.</description>

      <title>From S to 3XL: Implementing Data Partitioning and Tiered Storage</title>
      <description>Support of the large databases is not a trivial task. Large amount of data negatively impacts system performance and make administration and SLA compliance much more complicated. Data partitioning can help to solve those problems and reduce support and hardware cost. This session demonstrates various approaches of data partitioning available in SQL Server. It compares pros and cons of different partitioning techniques from performance, scalability and administration standpoints. The session also discusses how to reduce hardware cost by implementing tiered storage and demonstrates how to move data between filegroups and/or disk arrays keeping the system online in the different versions and editions of SQL Server. </description>

      <title>Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!</title>
      <description>Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.</description>

      <title>Discover, Document,  Diagnose Your Servers on Your Coffee Break</title>
      <description>Documentation is the bane of every DBA's existence. We all know we should do it but it's time consuming; by the time you're finally done it's probably out of date. Throw in the new servers you just found out about last week and keeping documentation up to date can turn into a full time job. And with everything we have to do in our day, who has time for that?

You need a way to work smarter, not harder, and automate your documentation. It can be done, and in this session you'll learn how to discover all the SQL Servers on your network, document their configuration from top to bottom (including OS details), and diagnose common problems before they turn into big headaches - all while you're on a coffee break. You'll look like a rock star without writing a line of code on your own or having to ask management to sign a check.


Attend this session and walk away with everything you need to generate documentation for your entire SQL Server environment on your first day back at the office</description>

      <title>Entity Framework: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learned to Love Developers</title>
      <description>Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

      <title>SSRS: On Premises or Azure? What's the difference?</title>
      <description>With a lot of companies looking to the cloud for cost savings, it helps to know what the differences are between on premises and cloud installations of your IT services. In this session, we'll take a look at SQL Server Reporting Services and the feature differences between deploying in the cloud, and deploying on premises. We'll look at different options for where you can deploy your reports as well. Also, Shannon Lowder will help with the associated costs of each solution, as well as preparing you for some of the gotchas you'll face as you move to the cloud today.</description>

      <title>Putting Quality Back Into Your Data Analysis</title>
      <description>This session introduces Data Quality Services, a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012. One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication. Sometimes when consolidating data from more than one source you have to transform data to create one standard set of domain values in a standard format. SQL 2012 answers this need with Data Quality Services (DQS). In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data. You will see how to build a domain both manually and from an existing data table. You will then see how to use these domains to validate tables in SQL Server and Excel preparing them for use in SSAS and PowerPivot. After this session, you will understand how by putting quality back into your data, you can be your organization's BI hero.</description>

      <description>Spatial data has been around since 2008 but it should fire it's PR person.  It's too bad that spatial data gets no love, it's actually something that pretty much all SQL Server shops could use.  This session will focus on utilizing these native types to store, analyze, and retrieve spatial data.  I will use some real world examples to help get the wheels turning on how you can use it within your organization and show how powerful it can be to see your data visually on a map.</description>

      <description>Learn how to use the Separation of Duties Framework and a Privileged Identity Management suite to minimize the permissions needed by DBAs to do routine work. I'll review the Separation of Duties Framework and an easy to implement, low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain the server but not be able to view user data.  I will prove that sysadmin is not always required more often than most DBAs think. Also, attendees will learn how to define a permission set with a single script that allows your company’s DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies.

      <title>Maximizing SSIS Package Performance</title>
      <description>So you've developed a whiz-bang SSIS package to push around a bunch of data. You save it, run it, and.... nothing happens - or it moves verrrrry slowly. Or perhaps you've got packages that run reasonably well, but you're convinced they could run faster. Where do you start troubleshooting? How do you eliminate those performance pain points?

In this demo-packed session, we'll work through some of the most common causes of performance bottlenecks in SSIS packages, along with recommended practices for maximizing performance. Among the topics we'll cover: troubleshooting methods to detect performance hotspots; optimizing sources and destinations for maximum throughput; choosing the most efficient data flow transformations; and using parallelism to improve performance.</description>

      <title>He Said - She Said:  A Telemcommuting Love Story</title>
      <description>He's been telecommuting in some capacity or another since before he was a DBA.  For 13 years he's been able to be a productive, responsive, integral and valuable asset to my company without maintaining a physical presence within the confines of a corporate office.  She's been telecommuting for less than a year and is directing a fleet of SQL BI Professionals for a Major Microsoft partner.  

Together, let's have a conversation and discuss what has (and has not) worked for us over the years.  Let's discuss the traits of a good telecommuter as well as those attributes that may not make this the right arrangement for everyone.  We will even discuss what our companies have done over the years to not only accommodate telecommuting, but to embrace and succeed from having staff that work remotely!  

Taken from the approach of a husband and wife team with different experiences in telecommuting, this session is aimed at staff, spouses and management alike.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analytics at your fingertips</title>
      <description>The Business Intelligence adoption over the last few years has grown dramatically to the point where organizations require business insights, not only from what has already happened (typical data warehousing), but from real-time performance and how will the future be, based on the business and market trends. In this session we will explore and demonstrate the main decision-making capabilities in SQL Server 2012 using Analysis Services, Data Mining and the power behind PowerPivot and PowerView hosted within Excel.</description>

      <title>Revenge: The SQL Part 2: The Sequel!</title>
      <description>In a world...where DBAs are blamed, mistreated, and overworked...one man...WILL. GET. EVEN. In this entertaining and impractical follow-up to the entertaining and impractical Revenge: The SQL, Rob Volk will show you even more impractical but oh-so-tempting ways to get back at those who abuse SQL Server and make you clean it up. Techniques will cover: preventing sa use, preventing ad-hoc SQL, cursors and missing WHERE clauses, and the ever-popular trigger mayhem. And if you stay for the after-credits sequence you may encounter the evil twins, duplicate primary keys!</description>

      <title>Building Your Professional Development Plan</title>
      <description>Plan the work and work the plan. Are you doing that when it comes to your professional development? Few of us have a formal approach to professional development and that usually means it gets pushed down the list as other things in life happen. This session is designed to get you thinking about all aspects of your career and from there moves into a discussion about time and money - how much of each are you willing to spend to get where you want to go? At the end of this presentation you'll be ready for spend a couple quiet hours charting all the things you want to do, and then figuring out which ones you really want to do.</description>

      <title>What the VLF? </title>
      <description>Experienced DBAs know that SQL Server stores data in data files and transaction log files. What is less commonly known is that the transaction log file is broken up into smaller segments known as Virtual Log Files, or VLFs. 

Having too many VLFs will cause performance to suffer. And having too few will cause backup performance to suffer. How do you strike the right balance?

In this more advanced session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will show you what VLFs are, how they're created, how to identify them, and how to strike the right balance between too few and too many.

That backup strategy is worthless and will cause your business to fail miserably while losing valuable customer data and more importantly you will lose my order of chicken wings! In this session you will learn why backup strategies are for losers, what can I do to keep from being a loser, and how can I build a winning strategy! </description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014: A First Look at What’s New!</title>
      <description>Microsoft has announced that our next version of SQL Server will be SQL Server 2014.  SQL Server 2012 had some major upgrades in AlwaysOn Availability Groups, ColumnStore Indexes, and Resource Governor.  SQL 2014 takes those features to the next level and introduces a whole lot more!  Rebuild Indexes and Statistics by Partition?  Yes!  A new Optimizer/Cardinality Estimator that you can choose for your Queries?  Yes!  Hekaton in memory data tables that exist separate to the buffer pool and use HASH indexes instead of B-TREE? YES!  Plus SSD Buffer Pool Extensions, Read-Write ColumnStore Indexes and much more!</description>

      <title>Maintaining Indexes in SQL Server</title>
      <description>So... you've created a bunch of indexes to improve the performance of your application, but then you start to notice performance degradation overtime. Digging further, you find that your indexes are not being maintained. In this session we'll look at some different systems that can be used for index maintenance. Additionally we'll explore some of the basic DMV's that provide us information about indexes.</description>

      <title>Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell</title>
      <description>Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.</description>

      <title>“Indexing” Encrypted Data</title>
      <description>As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.</description>

      <description>You probably know that indexes make you queries faster. But do you know why? Knowing how the different index types work under the covers will help you make the right decisions when (re-)designing you indexing strategy.
After attending this demo rich session you will be able to
-	Explain the differences between SQL Servers 9 "index" types
-	Identify the layout of SQL Server data on disk
-	Decide which index types are the right ones to use for a given query
-	Assess the impact of the Key on access speed

      <description>Being a full-stack .NET developer, I have written my fair share of T-SQL, but not until I became an accidental DBA did I find a new world of T-SQL options available to me.   In this session, I will go over a five T-SQL commands available since SQL Server 2005 and up that I have been completely missing.  We will evaluate the usefulness of  CTE, OUTPUT, MERGE, APPLY, and RANKING FUNCTIONS and how each of these can replace common cases you see everyday.</description>

      <title>DAX for T-SQL folks</title>
      <description>A lot of report development today is done through T-SQL using a lot of temp tables and aggregate functions. The reason for this is because a lot of database developers were scared of Analysis Services MDX and its complexity. Until SQL Server 2012 there was no other option in the Microsoft stack for a corporate BI solution until SQL Server 2012 and the BISM Tabular Model. BISM Tabular's query language is an Excel like language called Data Analysis Expressions (DAX). This session will cover some basic concepts of the DAX language and how powerful it is and why the T-SQL developer should consider it.</description>
