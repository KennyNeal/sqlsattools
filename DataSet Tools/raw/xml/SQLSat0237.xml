      <description>Mickey Stuewe has been working with SQL Server since 6.5. That gives her over 20 years of experience. She has not only been a database developer, but also an application developer, even before Visual Studio existed.

      <title>Inferred Dimension Members within MDS and SSIS </title>
      <description>Combining Master Data Services with Data Warehouses, will cause some challenges in ETL Scenarios. In this session we will go through a demo of Inferred Dimension Members implementation with SSIS considering the fact that MDS keeps the single version of truth for the dimension record.
In this session you will learn how we will write back new record's data into MDS entity as an Inferred member. The staging structure of Master Data Services and Batch Processing will be used for this. Then you will learn what is the best practice to add the inferred record into Data Warehouse dimension. Updating the existing dimension member also would consider the Inferred member and apply SCD types only if this is not an inferred Member.</description>

      <title>Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight</title>
      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>Change Data Capture tool for BI,Auditing,DR  more</title>
      <description>Change Data Capture (CDC) is one of the newest features available since SQL Server 2008 which allows you to easily track and keep history of all DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes on user tables such as INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE without additional overhead. One of the most important benefits of this feature is that it allows you to see the data before  after an UPDATE statement which allows you to recover data overwritten or deleted quickly without the need of a database restore. On this presentation we will go over the steps necessary to configure CDC and do an overview of some real world scenarios where this feature can be applied such as in ETL for Business Intelligence, Disaster Recovery, Auditing, and more.</description>

      <title>Understand Evaluation Contexts in DAX</title>
      <description>DAX is the query and programming language for future Microsoft BI solutions, yet many users found DAX hard to learn because they couldn't grasp what the "context" was. This session will turn you into a DAX expert by mastering this core concept of DAX. You will learn what row contexts and filter contexts are and how to access them. You will learn functions which create row and filter contexts. You will learn the initial contexts of a calculated column expression, a row level security expression, and a measure expression. You will learn how initial contexts are created from an MDX query. You will learn how to manipulate filter contexts using the overwrite and intersect semantics. You will see a lot of examples and learn a few DAX tricks along the way.</description>

      <title>DANGER: The Art and Science of Presenting</title>
      <description>Is there a great difference in the brain chemistry of someone fleeing a hungry mountain lion and someone presenting to a group of colleagues in a corporate board room? The answer is: NO. Over the past decade, a lot has been learned about the chemistry of the brain and why humans react the way we do to events in our environment. The concept of EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is a compelling and growing concept that applies this knowledge in a set of learnable, improvable skills for leading human beings. While EQ is often applied to corporate leadership, the parallels to presenting are fantastic. This session will explain the basics of EQ and demonstrate how you can apply it to make your presentations better in the following areas: * Crafting better slide decks * Preparing yourself for presenting * Delivering your content * Dealing with the unexpected Understanding and practicing the concepts of EQ can make your presentations a better experience for everyone in the room--including you.</description>

      <title>Automating SSIS Development with Biml</title>
      <description>SSIS is a great tool for transferring data from one data source to another, and for implementing complex ETL processes. However, there are some painful shortcomings that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, and create packages directly from schema information and other metadata.  The free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml). 
In this session we will start by showing the power of Biml.  We will then step back, and start from the beginning of using BimlScript.  Once we cover the basics, we will cover practical examples using the BIDS Helper add-in to automate SSIS development.</description>

      <title>Mastering the CUBE Functions in Excel 2013</title>
      <description>This session explores the seven CUBE functions that are natively available in Excel 2013. Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.

The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.

This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is also applicable to Excel 2007 and Excel 2010.</description>

      <description>Yes, you read the title right. 
No, it's not about the usual "one table per partition" and "restore full backup then copy the data over" methods.
No, there are no 3rd party tools involved. Just you and your SQL Server. 

Yes, it's crazy. No, it's not for production purposes. And yes, that's why it's so much fun.
Prepare to dive into the world of data pages, log records, deletes, truncates and backups and how it all works together to get your table back from the endless void.

      <title>Attributes  Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012</title>
      <description>The session explains Attributes and Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012 Semantic Model. They are used to slice (filter) and dice (group) measures and dimensions used to view analytical data.  The slicing and dicing of data involves fields, columns, or whatever you want to labeled them. But, in SQL Server Semantic model these are called Attributes and Hierarchies. The configuration of these slicers and dicers are important in SQL Server Analysis Services. This session will demonstrate the difference between an attribute and columns in a hierarchy in the dimension as well as the configuration of these for best performance and viewing.

      <title>Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS</title>
      <description>Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... 

In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.</description>

More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.</description>

      <description>Microsoft have released a distribution of Hadoop targeted at making big data accessible to everyone.  Hadoop is different to SQL Server.  Not necessarily better, just different.  It is a tool for a job.  if you have only ever worked with an RDBMS such as SQL Server then Hadoop is going to play with your mind a little and you are going to need to rethink a few things.
This session is going to take Hadoop and break it apart.  I will also look at some of the tooling Hive and Pig.
Keep an open mind and let me show you that Hadoop has lots to offer.
