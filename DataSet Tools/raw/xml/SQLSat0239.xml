      <title>Moving Enterprise database to cloud</title>
      <description>Windows Azure provides several different ways of storing and managing data. Windows Azure SQL Database and SQL Server in Windows Azure Virtual Machines are solutions in Windows Azure for working with relational data. If you are familiar with SQL Server, Windows Azure SQL Database will be a natural extension of your knowledge and skills. 
In this session, you will learn: 
1)	Windows Azure SQL Database - Learn how to get started. We will explore how to migrate an existing on-premise SQL Server database to Windows Azure SQL Database. We will then walk through how to manage and administer your Windows Azure SQL servers and databases. 
2)	 Provision the SQL Server VM on Windows Azure - We will learn provisioning the Virtual Machine through the Windows Azure Management Portal. Once created, we will open the VM through the Remote Desktop . Finally, we will connect to SQL server  using SSMS.

      <title>From Minutes to Milliseconds: High-Performance SSRS Tuning</title>
      <description>Even though you're an experienced report developer or administrator, performance tuning for SQL Server Reporting Services still feels as bewildering and hopeless as folding a fitted bed sheet. You've made your data sets smaller and timeouts longer, but it's not enough to remove the slowness dragging down your reporting environment.

In this session, you'll learn how design and configuration choices put pressure on your report server and techniques to relieve that pressure. You’ll see how to configure your Reporting Services databases for speed, houseclean your subscription schedules, and use caching for high-demand reports. You'll also learn some design strategies to lighten your report processing load. If you want to maximize the speed of your Reporting Services environment and minimize the pain of performance tuning, this session is for you.</description>

      <title>SSIS Incremental Load Design Patterns</title>
      <description>The volume of data addressed by the typical ETL operation is constantly on the rise.  Not so many years ago, a table with a few million records was considered to be huge.  These days, it's not uncommon to deal with multibillion row tables.  As a result, ETL professionals are frequently tasked with finding efficient ways to incrementally process these large sets of data without resorting to expensive and time-consuming destructive reloads. In this session, we will review the common decision points surrounding incrementally loading data, and will illustrate some of the design patterns for incremental processing.  Among the topics of discussion:-- Deciding whether an incremental load is appropriate-- Pick your tool: T-SQL or SSIS?-- Methods for detecting new and changed records-- Common incremental load design patterns</description>

      <title>XQuery Basics for the DBA</title>
      <description>For the past few years, XML has been making its way more and more into our SQL Server instances. For a moment let’s forget that developers often find the need to store XML data in their databases. Outside of those databases, XML has already invaded our SQL Servers. It’s made its way into execution plans with the SHOWPLAN XML. It’s telling us about deadlock through deadlock graphs. It’s also presented to us through service broke, event notifications, and extended events. XML is there and we need to learn how to query it. In this session, we’ll explore some of the basic methods for querying XML through XQuery. By the end of the session you’ll be equipped with the tools and understanding needed to ease yourself into XQuery. </description>

      <title>Prototyping with PowerPivot: Handling External Analysis Services 2012 Grouping</title>
      <description>Once the enterprise implements SSAS, immediate reporting benefits appear as the power of OLAP is unleashed in the speed of aggregations, the support of organization-wide ad hoc analysis and reporting, and myriad other advantages. A common need that then often arises is the capability to perform extra-hierarchy groupings. In this session, BI Architect and MVP Bill Pearson presents an approach to accomplishing external grouping with PowerPivot. We examine ways to accomplish a stated, example business need for such grouping via the addition of PowerPivot to an integrated Microsoft BI solution. Moreover, we discuss ways to design a scalable solution with PowerPivot that we can then entrain into the base warehouse / mart / cube structure. </description>

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

      <title>Unit Testing Fundamentals </title>
      <description>How can you be certain the "little change" you're about to make to that stored procedure isn't going to take down your whole company? Real developers use a technique called "Unit Testing" to minimize that risk, a concept that's also available to you. With unit testing you can quick ascertain whether the the changes to functions, stored procedures, and even other objects in your database had a negative unforeseen impact.

In this session we'll walk through the basics of what unit testing is, how to set up a simple Unit Testing project in SSMS, how we can tell whether something has negatively changed in our functions or procedures.  We'll also enumerate any 3rd party tools available to help us with Unit Testing our databases.</description>

      <title>An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL </title>
      <description>Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS.  However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case.

After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server.  We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.
