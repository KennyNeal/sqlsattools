      <title>Possible Musics:  Choosing between Analysis Services 2012 Multidimensional and Tabular</title>
      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models, developed by business users, to a dedicated server.  Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with Analysis Services 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths.  In this session, BI Architect, SSAS Maestro and MVP Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features.  He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing real world examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</description>

      <title>SQL 2012 Table Compression</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</description>

      <title>SQL 2012 Extended Events</title>
      <description>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008.  With SQL 2012, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature.  Join me for a little adventure into what extended events are.  We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration.  We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events.  </description>

      <title>SQL Server Page verification option, why it is important for every DBA?</title>
      <description>Are you 100% sure that your databases are corruption free? Do you know what page verification means? In this Level 300 session you will learn what page verification options are available to SQL Server and what each option does.
