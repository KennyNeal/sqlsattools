      <title>Disabling xp_CmdShell - Is it really a best practice?</title>
      <description>One of the most recommended "best practices" there is is to disable xp_CmdShell.  Whether you're pro, con, or just a casual user of xp_CmdShell, the first part of this "Black Arts" session will show you why disabling xp_CmdShell might actually be a bad idea depending on what else you do or don't do.  Then, for those folks that have made the extremely grave security mistake of giving users or apps the privs to run xp_CmdShell directly, you'll learn how to use a very simple method to allow the users/apps to use stored procedures that run xp_CmdShell without them having the privs to run xp_CmdShell directly themselves in a much more secure manner and all without certificates!.  If time allows, we'll also learn a method to greatly simplify PowerShell inputs to a table from T-SQL using only a single extra connection instead of two.

      <title>Temporary Objects Without Permanent Consequences</title>
      <description>Temporary objects like Table Variables and Temporary Tables are not inherently bad, but they are overused and misunderstood by many. Increase your understanding and learn when you should favor a Temporary Table over a Table Variable. We will start with the basics, but also look at execution plans to get a better grasp on the cause of those performance differences. Table-Valued Parameters are implemented as read-only Temporary Tables under the covers, and have some solid use cases. Discover how Table-Valued Parameters can be used to: 1) avoid the dynamic sql used by application code (or t-sql string splitting functions) to allow multi-value selection and 2) dramatically reduce the number of round trips between an application and SQL Server. </description>

      <title>Maximizing the Data Exploration Capabilities of Power View</title>
      <description>Would business users in your organization love to get their hands on an interactive, visually-oriented, data exploration tool? If so, Power View may be a useful addition to your BI environment to handle certain types of self-service reporting requirements. In this session we will demonstrate the features and functionality of Power View including highlighting, cross-filtering, play axis, small multiples, tiles, cards, maps, filtering, and exporting.

We will identify which situations Power View is most suited for, as well as its strengths and limitations. Capabilities in SharePoint 2010/2013 vs. Excel 2013 will be reviewed, as well as restrictions on types of data sources allowed. We will also discuss how to prepare a dataset in order to maximize the usability and functionality of Power View. </description>

      <title>A World Where All Data Has a Place to Live:  Centralizing Distributed Reference Data</title>
      <description>Have you ever started work on a project only to find that one of your key reference datasets is only available in a spreadsheet on somebody's desktop?  Even worse, you've probably run into situations where key data elements are 'common knowledge' amongst the business users, but don't even exist in a spreadsheet.  

Take heart.   Using Master Data Services (MDS) we now have an effective solution to this problem that has plagued IT for years, without having to create a custom solution.  In this session you will learn the basics of MDS, and how it can be used to easily create a home for the homeless data on your latest project.  Also, learn how Data Quality Services integration can be used to detect duplicate records, and perform cleansing operations.

Don't get hung up trying to build a custom solution to house homeless reference data during your next project.  Join this session and learn how to use MDS so you can deliver your project on time and on budget.</description>

      <title>T-SQL: Simple Changes That Go a Long Way</title>
      <description>Writing TSQL that performs well requires knowledge beyond proper syntax, sometimes it requires more than just knowing TSQL, and sometimes it takes a bit of rework and ingenuity. There are simple things that you will learn in this session that will improve the performance of your queries. Learn about indexing techniques and reading execution plans to see if the optimizer is using the index. Performance isn't everything though. There are small things you can do to make your TSQL more maintainable too. We will dive into a few TSQL tricks with Common Table Expressions, Table-Valued Parameters, and COALESCE.</description>

      <title>Partitioning for Perf and Mgmt of Large Tables</title>
      <description>Managing data in ever-growing transaction and history tables can be challenging. Activities with large chunks of data such as moving data to archive tables, batch-importing many rows, or defragging an entire table when only the active portion changes introduces heavy I/O and blocking. Table partitioning solves a host of headaches with minimal effort. Ever wanted to truncate or defrag part of a table, or insert an entire staging table of data into another table in milliseconds instead of hours?  Come see what partitioning can provide for you.</description>

      <title>Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies</title>
      <description>When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.</description>

      <title>Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell</title>
      <description>Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.</description>

In the first version of this presentation we discussed organization of the DMOs - this time around we're going to get our hands dirty and see how we can use them to collect baselines and plan for consolidations or migrations.</description>

      <title>Back(up) to Basics</title>
      <description>Are your databases being backed up? Are you sure? Are you sure they're being backed up correctly? Maybe you're an "accidental DBA" or a developer who's not quite sure of the answers to those questions. In this session, you'll learn what the different types of basic backups are, how to execute them, and (perhaps most importantly) how to restore from them if and when necessary.</description>

      <description>You got the "It's Slow" call, yeah you know the one.  There are many places to dig in and determine how true that is but we'll focus on what the server thinks utilizing Performance Monitor.  We'll go a bit deep into those facts in the poster on the wall and tell you the what/where/whys of it all.  We'll make sure you understand those items selected and what they mean.  We will also go through ways to quickly analyze that mountain of data collected.  </description>

      <title>Wrangling performance with Resource Governor</title>
      <description>In this introductory session we'll delve into the basics of the resource governor feature in SQL Server.  We'll look at the types of issues this feature can help resolve. We'll then delve into various components of the feature, such as a classifier function, workload groups and resource pools.  Finally we'll bring all this together with an example implementation. From there, if time allows, we'll look at best practices and questions to answer to ensure a successful implementation. </description>

      <title>Using Compression to Improve Database Performance</title>
      <description>Back in the old days, compression and databases was a really bad idea. Now, with powerful CPUs we can use to both improve performance and save disk space. We will cover the basics of how all compression and deduplication works, and then we will learn how SQL Server page and row compression work, and the special compression that is used in SQL 2012 Columnstore Indexes. We will demo performance and space savings in using compression.</description>

      <title>Interrogating the Transaction Log </title>
      <description>Without the transaction log, SQL Server would have no way of maintaining a consistent and durable view of its data.  It would be pandaemonium!!!  Think of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  

Thankfully the transaction log is there and we can all breathe easier.
In this session, you will learn how SQL Server uses the transaction log to maintain the durability and consistency of its data, along with methods for reading the transaction log and identifying active transactions.

      <description>Does this sound like you? You were just given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA and could use a daily report. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it‚Äôs deployed. We‚Äôll even look at the differences between building a report in BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) and Report Builder 3.0. We‚Äôll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2012. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output. </description>

      <title>DBA 911 - Database Corruption</title>
      <description>Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption.  In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands, monitoring for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when to restore versus repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for corruption, identify different types of corruption, and take the appropriate measures for dealing with it.
