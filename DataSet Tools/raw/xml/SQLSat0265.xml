      <title>Stop Schemers with Schema Security</title>
      <description>In releases prior to SQL Server 2005, database object owners and users were the same things. SQL Server 2005  introduced the concept of database schemas and the separation between database objects and ownership by users. An object owned by a database user is no longer tied to that user. The object now belongs to a schema – a container that can hold many database objects. The schema owner may own one or many schemas. This concept creates opportunities to expose database objects within a database for consumption yet protect them from modification, direct access using poor query techniques, or removal by users other than the owner.
 
The ability to protect database objects in this way has many practical applications. One example of relevance is the protection of database objects in application development environments where developers and testers share the same set of database objects. </description>

      <title>The Rise of the Flash Powered Economy</title>
      <description>Flash storage has revolutionized everything from smart phones and mobile computers, to web searches and social media. Unfortunately, it's been nearly impossible to deploy flash across a data center without breaking the bank. Pure Storage has cracked the code and destroyed the disk status quo. All-flash storage is now affordable enough to use broadly across any enterprise. Every company should enjoy the performance, space and efficiency advantages of flash as well as the lower maintenance, power, cooling, rack space and management costs. With Pure Storage, your business can achieve things that weren’t even imaginable with disk. No more wondering how much data you can analyze, how fast you can respond to a customer, or how quickly you can launch a new service. It’s time to unlock the productivity and creativity of your company while delivering a responsive experience to both customers and employees. All applications. All customers. All budgets. Flash for all.</description>

      <description>Sense that although you’re getting a lot done, you might not be doing the right things? Wonder if there are changes you could make to your life to get better results? Found something that really helps you to get more done? I’ve spent the last 15 years reading, listening and trying out everything I can find about self-improvement, trying to discover the silver bullet of effectiveness. I'll share what I’ve learned, and listen to what works for you. I’ve been able to apply statistical analysis and simple data mining to my own life and accelerate the pace of improvements. This session will briefly cover the basic themes of self-improvement literature, and then dive into how I found surprisingly helpful information using tools like Excel and Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services and how you can use them to search through the data in your life. Expect to walk away from this collaborative rambunctious session with a new perspective about what is possible.</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL for the SQL Server Pro</title>
      <description>PostgreSQL is a mature, robust and fast open-source database whose popularity grows with each new release. Let's take a look at the latest version of PostgreSQL, 9.3, and consider its strengths and weaknesses from an SQL DBA perspective. We'll dive right into the "why?" and look at some of the features Postgres has going for it, as well as some of its limitations. By the end, you should find Postgres operation and administration to be fairly similar to SQL Server, indefinitely configurable, and another good tool for any data pro's toolbox. 

I'll be demonstrating with Postgres 9.3 running on a CentOS 6.2 VM, if you would like to follow along, bring your own Linux box or Virtual Machine! </description>

      <title>DAX Evaluation Context</title>
      <description>DAX is the query and programming language for Analysis Services tabular models, yet many users found DAX hard to learn because they couldn't grasp what the "evaluation context" was. This session will turn you into a DAX expert by mastering this core concept of DAX. You will learn what row context and filter context are and how to access them. You will learn functions which modify row and filter contexts. You will learn the initial context of a calculated column expression, a row level security expression, and a measure expression. You will learn how initial context is created from an MDX query. You will learn how to manipulate filter context using the overwrite and intersect semantics. You will see a lot of examples and learn a few DAX tricks along the way.</description>

      <title>The Things You Don't Think About...</title>
      <description>As developers of data driven applications, we spend a lot of time thinking about performance. We read articles on how to best index, or how to how to write a better query. We make trial runs and analyze them using Show Plan. We read still other articles on using views, versus functions, versus stored procs. We learn patterns to write the most maintainable code. The list goes on…. But what about the things we don’t think about?From DMV’s to lesser talked about new features, The building blocks we code on haveall sorts of things going on that we all too often either don’t know or don’t think about. In this session, we’ll take a somewhat random stroll around data development and topics that you may not know about, or may simply have not thought about in a while, and examine what they mean to your code maintainability or performance.</description>

      <description>With the standard SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) engine, you can quickly and easily deliver basic charts. In real-life reporting, however, requirements are much more complex. You need to follow the techniques for enhanced information delivery by applying methods from Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, or Prof. Rolf Hichert, including ways to visualize by corporate identity or work with spatial information. This session focuses on charts, gauges, and maps and will show you advanced techniques that will help you get the most out of SSRS. We’ll cover tricks and workarounds, tips for building your own charting engine and creating your own maps, and ways to visualize data you never thought possible with Reporting Services. </description>

      <title>Common Table Expressions - Introduction</title>
      <description>Have you ever wanted to create a recursive query, but didn't see how to do it. With the Common Table Expressions session you will learn everything needed to start using CTE's for recursive queries, as temporary views, and to use the result set multiple times in the same query. Learn how simplify query syntax using CTE's. One of the most overlooked features of SQL Server is the CTE which not only simplifies the query, but gives you the ability to do things that would otherwise be impossible (or at least very challenging) with SQL Server. The class is designed for people who haven’t used CTE’s before, or for those who want to learn the basics of CTEs including data paging. This session pairs well with the Advanced Common Table Expressions ses</description>

      <description>You have been introduced to Common Table Expression, you understand the ;WITH syntax, but you want to know more. Learn how to recursive queries work with CTEs and how to display hierarchical data. Did you know that you can INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE data from CTEs. Some of the common use cases for CTEs will be covered including finding holes in patterns, finding and removing duplicate data, string parsing, and more.  See how CTEs compare to SQL Server 2012 offset and fetch paging techniques. Get an in depth understanding of the performance behind a common table expression. Understand when the CTE is the right solution, and the wrong solution to use. Finally we will take a look at some classic recursive algorithms and how they can be implemented with CTEs.

      <title>Data Quality: Tools and Techniques to Improve Data Quality</title>
      <description>The importance of data quality and common problems associated with data quality.
Companies spend considerable time and money making sure financial data is complete and correct, but don't always excercise the same care and processes with their operational data. This session will be centered on practical solutions, with just enough theory to give some context. It will include the following topics: 
- Data Screening: extensible approach to implementing data quality and monitoring it pioneered by Kimball Group.
- MS Data Quality Services: Overview of functionality and working examples and strong points/limitations.
- Combining data screens and DQS.
- Master Data or Data Quality: where to start</description>

      <title>Mastering the Excel CUBE Functions</title>
      <description>This session explores the seven CUBE functions that are natively available in Excel. Unknown to many business analysts, these useful functions can be used to retrieve data model members and values to create parameter-driven report designs.The session topics will introduce each of the seven functions. Demonstrations will range from the simple, to the more sophisticated involving dynamic expressions, MDX expressions, integration of data from multiple data models, and macro-driven layouts.This session is a must for those looking to drive more from Excel when reporting from the BI Semantic Model. Much of the content presented in this session is applicable to Excel 2007, 2010 and 2013.</description>

      <title>The Significance of Choosing and Using Data Types</title>
      <description>It's an all too common occurrence to have table columns or variables that have been assigned less than ideal data types. My goals in this presentation are to show you the importance of choosing the proper data type; show you some guidelines in determining what an appropriate data type would be; and once chosen, give you some tools for proper usage and management. I will demonstrate several performance and accuracy issues, along with their possible solutions, caused by either the assignment of imappropriate data types or improper usage of them. In addition, I will cover serveral data type related functions and point out caveates in their usage.</description>

      <description>Extended Events are used to gather performance information to help troubleshoot issues within SQL Server. The data can further be correlated with the OS and application event data by directing it to the Event Tracing for Windows log file (ETW). DBAs often need to identify the source of issues hindering database performance. This session will explore the data provided in a 2012 System Health event session. Cases studies  live demos will show how to use the various targets to find current performance bottlenecks and historical trends over time.</description>

      <title>Much Ado About Hadoop</title>
      <description>By now you've probably heard the words "Big Data" and "Hadoop", but you're not sure what they mean, much less how to get started. Maybe you're struggling with storing a lot of data, rapidly processing a huge volume of data, or maybe you're just curious. There are a bewildering array of options and use cases within the Hadoop ecosystem. Every day I help customers understand their data problems, understand where Hadoop fits into their environment, and determine how they can use Hadoop to solve their problem. This session provides an introduction to what Hadoop is, when it's appropriate to use Hadoop, and guidance on how to get started. </description>

      <title>Developers vs. DBA's:  Cats  Dogs</title>
      <description>Application Developers focus on delivering working code, while DBA's focus on Data Quality.  Since developers vastly outnumber us, we must - somehow - persuade them that our objectives are important, too.  This, in turn, requires that we understand the source of the conflict and learn to see the world from multiple points of view.</description>

      <title>Where did I put my (primary) keys?</title>
      <description>In this session we will revisit some of the fundamental design principals of relational databases: normalization rules, key selection, and the controversies associated with these issues from a practical perspective.
We will consider the benefits and challenges of using different types of keys - natural, surrogates, artificial (and others?) from multiple aspects: data consistency, application development, maintenance, portability and performance.</description>

      <title>What to Look for in Execution Plans</title>
      <description>You've heard often enough that you need to look at execution plans to understand what's going on with a query. But what are you supposed to look at? This session answers that question, providing a step-by-step set of considerations for evaluating your execution plans. We'll look at the aspects of an execution plan that should be immediately checked, why they should be checked, and provide some guidance for what to do about what you find. You'll be able to apply this information to your SQL Server 2012 systems as well as older versions of SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Lunch: Performance Troubleshooting with DMVs</title>
      <description>There are many tools for a DBA to use for performance troubleshooting. One of the best tools are Dynamic Management Views and functions (collectively referred to as DMVs). DMVs offer insight into the inner workings of SQL Server and helps you identify symptoms and track down root cause. The trick is knowing which DMVs to use and how to interpret the data. This session will detail the DMVs that are most useful in troubleshooting performance problems and will show you how to use the information to reach resolution.</description>

      <title>Physical Join Operators</title>
      <description>SQL Server implements three different physical operators to perform joins. In this session we will examine how each of these operators work, its advantages and challenges. We will try to understand the logic behind the optimizer's decisions on which operator to use for various joins using (semi) real life examples and we will see how to avoid common join related pitfalls.</description>
