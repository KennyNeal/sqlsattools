      <title>Power View from the Data Visualisation Perspective</title>
      <description>Power View is Microsoft's Data Visualisation tool. Where does it get it right, and where does it get it wrong? Using demos, we learn about Power View whilst assessing it based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles by luminaries such as Stephen Few, Tufte and others. We will:

- investigate Power View based on current cognitive research around Data Visualisation principles
- look at the features of Power View
- look at where Power View is supplemented by other parts of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack

Come to this session if you really want to think about the best ways of presenting data to your Business Intelligence data consumers, and see how to apply these principles in Power View.</description>

      <title>SQL Server and XML Query</title>
      <description>XML was added to the collection of SQL Server native data types in SQL Server 2005. Being a complex data type, not only is XML accompanied by a set of dedicated T-SQL functions, but also with a complete querying language. In this session you will learn about the Microsoft SQL Server 2008 implementation of the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Query Recommendation, and learn how to compose XML data – from existing SQL Server data or simply "from scratch", how to retrieve (relational) data from XML Documents to be used in a SQL Server database, and how to manipulate XML data using Transact-SQL and the XML Data Manipulation Language (XML DML). You've already mastered all the primitive SQL Server data types, why would XML be an exception?</description>

      <description>You’re a developer or a DBA, and you’re comfortable writing queries to get the data you need. You’re much less comfortable trying to design the right indexes for your database server. In this session with Microsoft Certified Master Brent Ozar, you’ll role play as the database engine while Brent gives you queries. You’ll learn first-hand about clustered indexes, nonclustered indexes, execution plans, sargability, statistics, TempDB spills, and T-SQL anti-patterns.</description>

      <title>Analytical Data Mining - Using Data Mining to Understand Data</title>
      <description>Data mining is a technique used to derive previously unknown information from large amounts of data. The process of this knowledge discovery can help uncover new patterns within data and help analysts better understand the large datasets. Additionally, once these patterns have been defined, you can use them as part of predictive modelling estimating the likelihood of some event occurring.

SQL Server Analysis Services includes a data mining engine that can be used at various levels within an organization, from analyst to developer. This session will look at data mining as tool for data investigation by the business analyst.  We examine the business case, requirements and outcomes of data mining so that it can enhance our understanding of datasets. We will look at both simple and complex implementations of data mining that allow new information to be extracted from data and used in novel ways within the MS Stack.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014 In-Memory OLTP / XTP Management Deep Dive</title>
      <description>You have heard about Hekaton, respectively the new Acronym XTP (eXtreme Transactional Processing) and you want to know how it works under the cover? In this session we will take a closer look at the architecture, where the performance benefits come from and how it works in detail. What kind of files is SQL Server using for transactional consistency, what happens when you delete data inside the log and inside the data files. We will see the Merge-Process and the Garbage collector in action, see how memory management works for XTP enabled databases, and thereby get an in-depth understanding of how this completely new storage engine works and how to optimize for it.</description>

      <description>SharePoint databases are considered a black box - touch them and you lose support. Furthermore, SharePoint leaves an unintelligible track of database names and GUIDs on your server. They are supposed to scale, but how and how much? Here are some techniques DBAs should be aware of to optimize SharePoint performance and scalability. This demo-packed session, based on real-life experiences, will show you how to tune your SQL Server for SharePoint and how to customize your SharePoint installation so that it fits your IT conventions, not the other way around.</description>

      <title>Handling Errors and Data Anomalies in SSIS</title>
      <description>Even in the most reliable ETL system, it's eventually going to happen: A package will fail, an output row count won't match what is expected, a data anomaly will force a forensic search of the package infrastructure... In this session, we'll talk about some of the things that can go wrong during package execution - and some of the defenses that can be built into SSIS to help head off those errors (or at least make the errors easier to troubleshoot). From error handlers to package restartability, and from logging methods to row count validation and remediation, we'll cover various ways to keep your ETL flowing when problems arise.</description>

      <description>My first experience with MDX was: good, it looks like SQL: SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE. On my second glance it turned out to be completely different than SQL. But after a while SQL and MDX started to feel similar. In this session I bring you to the point of seeing the similarities instead of the differences. We will use your SQL experience to give you a head start with MDX. The session is also good for those with a bit of experience who want to know a bit more about the background. Of course all theory is backed by demo’s.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014 - New Cardinality Estimator</title>
      <description>In SQL Server 2014 query processing has been improved. What we can expect from new cardinality estimator? Does it really estimate better? Will our execution plans be better after migration to 2014? All of them? Is the key ascending column statistics problem solved in new version? Do we finally can have more than 200 steps in the statistics histogram per table? What about column correlation and cardinality estimates - are the predicates still completely independent?

This session will answers all these questions and will demonstrate new query processing capabilities and compare them with those from SQL Server2012.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Data Tools - The IDE for database developers</title>
      <description>Since March 2012, SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) are available for database developers as a project-based development environment within Visual Studio.

Although SSDT is installed automatically with Visual Studio 2012, this method of database development and the functions provided are completely new to many developers.

This session aims to change that and to provide an overview of the advantages and potentials of SSDT. You will see how you can develop, debug, refactor, deploy and maintain SQL Server and Azure databases from a single IDE.</description>

      <title>Clustered Instance - Storage Introduction</title>
      <description>With the evolution of SQL Server new possibilities are being opened, and today we have a vast range of possibilities to achieve our objectives. For a clustered instance is not different, as nowadays a shared storage living in a SAN is not the only possibility. 

On this session I will introduce all the available ways to store database files in a clustered SQL Server instance, including the news of SQL Server 2014. If you never installed or even worked with a clustered instance, this is not an issue! A quick introduction about the role of clustered instance will be made.

I'll wait for you there!

      <description>Power Query the new Excel Add In is a great data exploration toolset combined with other add ons
like Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map This session will take a deep dive into the language behind
the Power Query: "M". We will take the language concepts and possibilities and try to compare them
with another cool kids in town: "R" and "P" aka Python.  What possibilities
do these languages offer, where can you use them best and how good is the integration to the Microsoft stack.
The session is driven by demos and you will take away a good starting point how to work with these three
languages.

      <description>Have you ever flipped the pages of Books Online, only to find that the aggregate function you need is simply not there? So why not add it?
Ever since SQL Server 2005, you can easily create your own aggregate functions. All it takes is a bit of .NET code.
This session will show you exactly how to create a CLR user-defined aggregate function, and how to use it in your queries. But it will also show you many workarounds to avoid having to do this for many commonly requested aggregates.</description>
