      <title>The 'Secret Sauce' in your Big Data: R, HDInsight and PowerBI</title>
      <description>Big Data is not so much about storing massive amounts of data in a common database. It is also a force of change for the organisation, and it means that we have to consider the collective capabilities of the platform to serve the business: from data source to secret sauce to help the business to make data-driven decisions to drive the enterprise forward. How can you get your organisation's secret sauce? Data scientists need a way of combining the scalability of Big Data with the ability to conduct extensive data analysis to obtain the 'secret sauce'. In this session, we will look at R, the world's favourite free data analysis tool, and HDInsight, which is Microsoft's distribution of Hadoop. In this session, we will look at an end-to-end solution to discover our secret sauce from data ingredients. We will then visualise the results in Microsoft's latest BI toolset, Power BI.</description>

      <title>ETL for the masses with Power Query and "M"</title>
      <description>Power Query allows users to incorporate public data and organizational data seamlessly in Excel. The purpose of this session is to take a deeper dive into the capabilities of Power Query and of the "M" language.
The more I use Power Query and the M language that underpins it, the more I see how useful it is – quite apart from its abilities to import data from other data sources – as a third option to solve problems in Excel itself. Furthermore it provides a simple interface over the data transformation engine (powered by M), and it has become a tool of choice anytime I need to get data into Excel. 
In this demo-driven session I will show how you can use Power Query to do some initial data shaping, visualize, and then automate the data loading process through SSIS.

      <title>FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them</title>
      <description>Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous d</description>

      <title>MDS + DQS + SSIS = EIM or How to build master data management solution</title>
      <description>The process of entering data into corporate dictionary is not as simple as you can see at the first glance. Just imagine the process of collection information about the new retail store. It starts from discovering the possible place, then estimating the size, format and revenue, making a decision to buy or rent this place and so on. At the end you have to liquidate the goods remained unsold, reassign you workers to another store, demount all equipment, close accounts, etc.  This process may involve 5, 10 and even 20 different workers who collect and enter different pieces of information about a retail store.
At this session we will talk about the approaches of creating a master data management solution and take a look at the implementation with the services of Microsoft SQL Server 2012.</description>

      <title>SQL Server HA and DR in a Windows Azure Virtual Machine – Deep Dive</title>
      <description>Windows Azure gives you a choice in where to host your SQL data, with both SQL Server running in a VM and Windows Azure SQL database. Ongoing innovations in SQL/VM and SQL DB enable both low overall TCO for management of existing applications/services and an efficient platform for the new breed of cloud applications/services. Additionally the ability to mix and match existing and new applications in the same hosted service, and to integrate with on-premises applications and networks in hybrid models provides tremendous flexibility. This session will take a deep look at the best practices when provisioning and deploying a SQL Server in a Windows Azure Virtual Machine.</description>

      <description>For the first time since SQL 7 there is a compelling reason for EVERY SQL Server user to upgrade to the next version and this time around the reason is Windowing Functions.   And these are NOT limited to Enterprise Edition, like so many other really useful and important features!  The range of data processing needs that can be very efficiently and cleanly solved with these tools is stunning. In this demo-packed session we will cover as many features as we can pack into an hour's time, and you can take the demo code back home with you to review at your leisure!</description>

      <title>Temporal Data in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Although temporal data is part of many business applications, most RDBMS’, including SQL Server, do not support it out of the box. However, SQL Server provides full infrastructure to build your own temporal data support. After introduction of temporal problems, we are going to develop interval CLR data type that supports validity time. Then we are going to discuss what kind of constraints pertain to temporal data, and how we can implement those constraints. We are going to use T-SQL to develop two very useful temporal operators: PACK and UNPACK. In addition, we are going to introduce the proposed sixth normal form that deals with temporal data, and show how you can implement it correctly.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analysis Services in the Cloud</title>
      <description>Over the last years Analysis Services has proven its scalability with big data volumes and also with many users. Those high-end solutions are usually very strongly tied to the hardware they are running on. When moving those solutions to the cloud we need to reconsider this whole setup as a single on-premise hardware still outperforms a cloud machine by far. In order to achieve the same overall performance we need to scale out our Analysis Services instances across multiple hosts in the cloud and that's what this session is about.</description>

      <description>You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.</description>

      <title>Windows Azure SQL Database - your cloud database and why you need it</title>
      <description>This session will take an exploratory look at Microsoft's cloud-based relational database offering. We'll lift the hood and look at its many benefits and features, and how it easily fills the need for a highly available and scalable database service in the cloud. We'll discuss how the database formally known as SQL Azure helps ease provisioning and deployment, and how Microsoft takes care of the physical administration so that developers and DBA's alike can focus on the aspects of their job they really care about.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Data Tools - The IDE for database developers</title>
      <description>Since March 2012, SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) are available for database developers as a project-based development environment within Visual Studio.

Although SSDT is installed automatically with Visual Studio 2012, this method of database development and the functions provided are completely new to many developers.

This session aims to change that and to provide an overview of the advantages and potentials of SSDT. You will see how you can develop, debug, refactor, deploy and maintain SQL Server and Azure databases from a single IDE.</description>
