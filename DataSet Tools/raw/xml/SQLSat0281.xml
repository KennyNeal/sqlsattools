      <title>Keynote and Introduction: SQL Server 2014 and BI overview</title>
      <description>We are entering a time of a paradigm shift in the world of data platform and business intelligence. As data platform technologists and community members, we are at the heart of this opportunity. Come hear how Azure, Power BI, SQL 2014 are just the front of a wave of technologies that are going to change how we design, build and manage a new world of solutions.
A graduate of the University of Glasgow and the University of Aberdeen, and the key organiser of SQLSaturday Edinburgh, Jen has nearly twenty years experience delivering artificial intelligence and business intelligence solutions. Jen has been through a number of industry changes, and is excited to be a part of the most recent one moving to the cloud. 
This session will help to orient you for the rest of SQLSaturday Edinburgh, and we hope you enjoy your day.</description>

      <title>A One Hour Data Analysts Toolkit: using R and Power View</title>
      <description>If you want to conduct advanced Business Intelligence development and Business Analysis, then it is useful to understand data visualisation and have R as a tool in your toolset. In this intensive one hour session, we will look at the latest suite of Microsoft Business Intelligence tools - Microsoft Power BI in conjunction with R. The demos will be implemented in both tools in an end-to-end hour long session so that delegates can see when to use each technology in order to determine 'what to use' and 'when to use it', as well as seeing where the technologies complement each other. We will visualise the data according to data visualisation principles set out by Stephen Few amongst others.</description>

      <title>SQOOP - Taking relational data to Hadoop and back again</title>
      <description>SQOOP or SQL to Hadoop is a tool in the Hadoop ecosystem that lets you take your "SQL" data and put it into Hadoop or vice versa.  The use cases are numerous.  You can have Hadoop perform the heavy lifting using Map Reduce and then use SQOOP to take the results and put them in "SQL".  You can have Hadoop act as your Data Warehouse and use SQOOP to do your daily loads from your relational DB into Hadoop.
SQOOP is a command line tool but don't let that put you off.  
This session will look at SQOOP and the plethora of options available to you on the command line.  If you want to learn about SQOOP then this is the session for you.

      <title>Migrating to PDW? Lessons from the Field </title>
      <description>Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) isn't SQL Server - it's different. It's bigger than that. It's a massively parallel-processing, distributed-database platform that leverages SQL Server as part of its architecture. But it has so much more to offer...

 In this 1-hour session, you will learn how to "embrace the change" and accelerate your migration to the data warehouse storage engine for the Microsoft Data Platform. This session will be packed with advice and recommendations from actual customer deployments and real-world experiences. Get on board the PDW train, and transform your data warehouse with the Microsoft Big Data Analytics Appliance! </description>

      <title>Autogenerating a process data warehouse</title>
      <description>In many data warehouses we model fact tables with measures based on attributes which we can count and do arithmetic upon. It is more difficult to handle fact tables with measures based on length of intervals of events happening in the source systems. So questions like "What are the typical waiting times in our order process?" are seldomly modelled in the data warehouse. Especially if the event data comes from different source systems. 

In this talk I will show you how Rehfeld has overcome this difficult problem using an autogenerated datawarehouse based on metadata on the objects in the EDW/DM layers. In this approach you can autogenerate the process data warehouse if only you have the timestamps present in the EDW layer and are able to correlate them. The talk will consist of slides and demos.</description>

      <title>MDS and DQS - Beyond the TLAs to Data Quality</title>
      <description>Many three-letter acronyms (TLAs) adorn our database world. This session focuses on two recent additions – MDS (Master Data Services) and DQS (Data Quality Services) – explaining what the new features are and exploring how to leverage them to improve your data quality. 

High data quality is fundamental to any business analytics system. In this session, we’ll begin with an overview of data quality and the latest Microsoft tools available, and then demonstrate MDS and DQS and how to use them together for continuously improving data quality. We’ll also look at how to integrate them into your existing data-quality strategies. Data quality is everyone’s responsibility – but we can still lead the way forward. Join this session to see how.</description>

      <title>Automate your SSIS development with BIML</title>
      <description>Ever tried to import a file with the Import/Export wizard?
Or created a bunch of SSIS packages to process a data warehouse load?
Then you know how much work it is to specify the metadata correctly just to create a package that actually works.
Wouldn't it be cool if you had a descriptive language which looks at your metadata and just created the packages for you?
This is what BIML is all about. 
In this session I explain what BIML is, how it works and I'll show you how you can generate your packages and quickly respond to changes.
You can expect a demo rich session with lots of notes from the field and practical examples.
This is not just for BI developers, DBA's or SQL dev's who need to import or export data occasionally will learn some quick and easy tricks as well.

      <description>Well - they named it SQL2014 In-Memory OLTP tables - BUT that does not mean we can't optimize our BI solutions with this new feature.  
This demo intensiv session is build around a number of hypothesis that are testet and show what we can - and cannot optimize with In-Memeory tables covering both the ETL and (R)OLAP angels of the BI process.

Especially when there exists up to five different IT systems per field, and that the municipalities can use the systems differently. Add to this a requirement to change the business rules for each municipality, and the ability to report on one municipality, while data for another municipality is updated.

The talk is relevant for DBA's, (BI) developers and BI architects.</description>

This session will cover essential information about Google Analytics and its API guidelines, competitors, and most important, how you can use the data from such offerings together with your ERP, CRM, and other OLTP systems.

You will see how to load Google Analytics data using SQL Server Integration Services, for example, and merge that data with your local data. In addition, we will walk through a demonstration of important web analytics KPIs and how you can analyze them using Microsoft Business Intelligence tools.</description>

No more development, no more manual work.
But what about the partitions on the cube? Do we really need to tell and learn the DBA how to handle that on a periodic plan?
The answer is simple: No!

SQL Reporting provides many benefits, including rapid provisioning, cost-effective scalability, high availability, reduced management overhead and secure access for viewing and managing reports.
VM SSRS provides SQL Reporting service under IaaS model which will be consumed by client application or service. This SSRS is hosted on the Azure VM. This presentation compares SQL Azure reporting with IaaS VM reporting.</description>
