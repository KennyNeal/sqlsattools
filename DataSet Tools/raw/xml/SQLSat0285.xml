      <title>Everything You Ever Knew About SSIS Is Null and Void</title>
      <description>With the release SQL Server Integration Services 2012, Microsoft did a massive overhaul to the deployment platform for SSIS. Gone is the old file based deployment system and MSDB. New to SSIS is the Integration Services Catalog. 

Along with the catalog came many new improvements, such as package and project parameters. No longer do you have to mess around with ugly configuration files, or the mess of passing data between packages. Also included are new reports which you can use to examine your packages as they run, or see the status of past runs. 

In this session we'll look at how the new project based deployment model simplifies your SSIS coding. We'll also take a dive into the catalog, uncovering the wealth of information it can provide.

      <title>Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies</title>
      <description>When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, we will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.</description>

      <title>Peace of Mind: Making DBCC CHECKDB Go Faster</title>
      <description>Along with backups, consistency checks are arguably the two most important tasks that DBAs need to perform regularly. Our databases are getting bigger every day, and CHECKDB run times, along with its performance impact to Production systems, keep increasing. In this session we discuss how to improve your system so that you can reduce the time that it takes to run CHECKDB or the individual DBCC CHECK* commands. We will cover topics like Transaction log and VLF management, tempdb configuration, trace flags, Resource Governor, and many more. In one of many the demos we will explore a real life example where SurveyMonkey's consistency checks were taken from 7 days down to 6 hours. </description>

      <title>Statistics and Query Optimization</title>
      <description>There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.</description>

      <title>SQL 2012 Table Compression</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit.  We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server.  What some may not know is the subtleties of compression.  Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed.  This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level.  At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database.  Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</description>

      <description>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</description>

      <title>Entity Framework: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Learned to Love Developers</title>
      <description>Do you have applications in your environment that don't use SQL written by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are the system is utilizing Microsoft's Entity Framework.

Entity Framework (EF) and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is Entity Framework a technology that developers should even be using? In this session, we'll review what Entity Framework is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how Entity Framework works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by Entity Framework. Finally, we'll review T-SQL generated by Entity Framework and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional that manages databases that are accessed through Entity Framework or would like a basic knowledge of how Entity Framework works this session is for you.

      <title>Database Development Comes out of the Dark Ages</title>
      <description>Database development has traditionally been done using SQL Server Management Studio query window as the primary tool, when far more powerful tools are available in your toolset. This is the equivalent of writing a document using Notepad, when MS Word is available on your desktop. This session will take you through some of the basics of using SSDT, show you how to use VS2012 database projects effectively, how to utilize TFS build, test and deploy your code. I've had my share of bumps on the road to deploying these toolsets. At the end of this session you will have a good introduction into how to use the tools and how to avoid some common issues with legacy code you are already have in your environments.</description>

      <title>Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml</title>
      <description>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Scott Currie (the creator of Biml) will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Scott will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.</description>

      <title>Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell</title>
      <description>Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination.  Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again.  BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy.  In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.</description>

      <description>With the increasing adoption rate of virtualization, creating SQL Server clusters is now within reach of many more DBAs. What do you need to know about Windows Server 2012 (R2) virtualization and high availability to set up your first cluster? What's needed for geo-clustering? Come learn from a Windows Server admin and (accidental) DBA who's been building SQL Server clusters since 2000 (the year and the version!). We'll discuss initial planning, the process and the maintenance best practices. There will be demos too, so if you want to see a multi-node SQL cluster run on a Lenovo X230 tablet, come see (it's pretty cool!).</description>

      <description>If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language. Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply? In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server</title>
      <description>Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little  tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. Once virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine. David Klee (@kleegeek) will discuss valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. Tips on configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized will be covered in detail.</description>

      <title>The 20-Minute Tabular Model</title>
      <description>The Tabular model is the new kid on the block in Analysis Services 2012. Based on xVelocity, a new highly compressed in-memory technology, Tabular models promise considerable performance improvements over Multidimensional models in many scenarios. But, as is the case with any new technology, there are certain limitations of which to be aware. Join me in this introductory-level session focusing on how Tabular fits into the Microsoft BI stack, the major factors to consider when choosing between Tabular and Multidimensional technologies, and finally a live demo where we'll build a basic Tabular model in visual studio.</description>

      <title>Administering  Managing the Power BI Environment</title>
      <description>Power BI for Office 365 is Microsoft's new self-service BI offering. Just because it emphasizes self-service doesn't mean a system administrator isn't an important role! In this session we will discuss the overall system components and how a Power BI site in SharePoint Online differs from an on-premises SharePoint BI site.  We will walk through how to best handle setting up connectivity to data sources, when a gateway is needed, and what data refresh capabilities exist. We will also consider how and when to create OData feeds from your corporate on-premises data sources, and how those OData feeds affect Enterprise Data Search functionality.</description>

      <title>Automating Execution Plan Analysis</title>
      <description>Many SQL Server performance issues can be solved with the information from the DMVs, even if it is collected only after the occurrence. But why was it fine yesterday and a problem today? On modern server systems, problems may be infrequent, but they do still occur. And so we may have neglected to collect data on a routine basis. It is important to collect sufficient information to diagnose and a resolve a problem. Too many third party tools to stop after identifying a problem on the presumption that the DBA’s responsibility ends with passing this information to someone else. I have automated the collection and partial analysis of index usage, query execution statistics and executions plans in my tool ExecStats.</description>

      <description>SQL Database is part of the Microsoft Azure platform. The SQL Database component provides the relational database functionality of SQL Server, but it also provides functionality as a cloud-computing service, hosted in Microsoft data-centers around the globe. We will go over how it works and what it has to offer, as well as some of the differences and limitations.

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>In this session I will give an overview of how to design a database, including the common normal forms and why they should matter to you if you are creating or modifying SQL Server databases. Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against the way data should be structured and can be avoided by applying the basic normalization techniques and are obvious things that you find yourself struggling with time and again (i.e. using the SUBSTRING function in a WHERE clause meaning you can't use an index efficiently).

      <description>Despite SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) being a very flexible and adaptable tool when it comes to visualization techniques, very few venture beyond its ready-made charts. Most of the time, all it takes to build a chart considered “outside the scope” of SSRS is a bit of lateral thinking. Sometimes, we need to go a little further and use custom code. Join this session as we bust popular myths around "impossible in SSRS" visualizations and construct them live in SSRS!</description>

      <description>SQL Audit provides the ability to track and log activities and changes at the instance or database level built upon Extended Events SQL Audit provides both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities. The granularity of events that can be monitored and tracked with SQL Audit can only be matched by means of using a SQL Profiler trace, but provides reduced overhead. This presentation will provide insight into the internals of SQL Audit, along with how to plan, create, and monitor instance and database level audits.

      <title>READY FOR PROD</title>
      <description>As a DBA, my personal least favorite part of the development lifecycle is pushing changes to production. It means adding something unknown (no matter how well tested) to an environment that is considered stable and reliable.  Plus there are other things that myself (and I'm sure developers as well) would rather be doing.

In READY FOR PROD (caps for emphasis), we will explore how I believe pushing T-SQL script, SSRS reports, and SSIS packages to production should go, and I encourage those in the audience to participate so we can get an idea of how other environments push code as easily or painfully as possible.</description>

      <title>What’s Simple About SIMPLE Recovery?</title>
      <description>There is a common misconception that SIMPLE Recovery means no logging, and this is a very dangerous myth to propagate. SQL Server does log database changes in SIMPLE Recovery, but some (not all) operations are minimally logged. In this presentation, I'll tell you what minimal logging means in conjunction with each of the three different recovery models. In addition, I’ll describe the benefits and dangers of the SIMPLE Recovery Model. </description>

      <title>Crazy Things That Developers Do</title>
      <description>Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn what we do (from opening up the database to SQL Injection attacks, how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries, and the pitfalls of using NOLOCK), why it's bad to the database server (or your career)... and alternatives that can be used instead. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.</description>

      <description>You're a new DBA, want to be a DBA or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings.  Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  Their query or stored procedure took a very long time to run.  Can you help them?  Do you even know where to begin to help them?  Most sessions I've attended on performance tuning seem to start in the middle.  They take the approach that the audience has some understanding on how or where to start.  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow".  </description>

We will use real world examples where data redundancy is needed and discuss which is the appropriate technology and why. This is more than just a high availability vs disaster recovery discussion. If you have ever been confused or overwhelmed by all of the options, they will be broken down and made clear in this session.</description>

      <title>GIS Data and Solving the Shortest Path</title>
      <description>GIS data is used everywhere for many reasons.  We are all used to digitally navigating maps on our computer or device.  How can we use Sql Server and a network (map) to solve some of those same problems without leaving the server’s process?  Then, once you have solved a network for one business case, what other problems can you solve with the same algorithm but in a different business domain and using a different network?</description>
