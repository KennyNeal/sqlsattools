      <description>Hi, my name is Jason I'm a practice lead at Redapt. I spend most of my day helping clients solve business problems mostly in the Data and Advanced Analytics spaces. Sometimes this involves various and sundry cloud technologies including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Azure Data Lake Store, Azure Databricks, HDInsight and Azure SQL Database. I'm fluent in several languages including: SQL, C#, Python, and PowerShell.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Master of SQL Server (MCM) and have been recognized for my technical excellence and evangelism efforts by Microsoft by being awarded the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the last 5+ years.

      <title>Faster  Leaner: Optimize DW Solution Delivery with Power Pivot and AS Tabular</title>
      <description>You may not see this in the marketing materials, but the reality is PowerPivot and AS Tabular together provide some powerful options for Data Warehousing professionals.  This session is for DW  dimensional modeling pros interested in streamlining  optimizing the design  delivery process for enterprise-quality data marts  dimensional semantic models.

We'll touch on Agile  Lean disciplines,  how they can be applied to DW solution delivery. Then we’ll walk through demos of practical applications in the form of PowerPivot POCs  prototypes that can be promoted to AS Tabular models and refitted to the finished DW structures once delivered. We’ll focus on key DW challenges and how these technologies and techniques can be used to speed and improve effectiveness of requirements gathering and user testing, optimize sequencing of deliverables, minimize risk of rework and ultimately deliver quality DW solutions successfully.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014 for Hybrid Cloud </title>
      <description>The cloud is here and Hybrid cloud can help you get started and move forward! Cloud computing brings a new paradigm shift in computing and organizations continue to realize the potential cost benefits of running their database applications in the cloud with greater scale and flexibility.  Take almost any application scenario, from the largest public websites to small departmental applications, and you will find the vast majority of organizations look to take advantage of cloud computing, the availability of cloud-enabled database systems will be critical to their success. This session looks at the Microsoft vision of relational database management systems in the context of cloud computing. It is a hybrid IT vision that gains leverage from the industry-standard Microsoft SQL Server technology set and makes it available across the spectrum of deployment approaches organizations can take today.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Security 101</title>
      <description>SQL Server security sound simple.  We grant permissions to people and processes that need access to our SQL Server instances and databases, while controlling which data they can access and what actions they can perform.
    However, behind this simple statement lies much complexity.  In practice, it is easy for the novice database administrator to get lost in the hierarchy of principals, securables and permissions that comprise the SQL Server security architecture.  The most common result is the path of least resistance, where people end up with "too many privileges."  
    My primary goals are to provide a simple, concise description of how the SQL Server permission hierarchy works, and then demonstrate, step by step, how to implement the "Principle of Least Privilege" in securing SQL Server.  
    I will also mention security-related items that are new to SQL Server 2014.

      <description>Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!</description>

      <title>Creating SSRS Reports Efficiently Through Best Practices</title>
      <description>You always have more report requests than you can possibly fulfill. Wouldn’t it be great if you could speed up the generation of reports? Templates can streamline the life cycle of a report for the whole team. In this session, you’ll learn how templates in your tool belt can help you efficiently gather requirements, quickly design mock-ups, and standardize the look and feel of your SSRS reports. 
Reports don’t stop changing once they’re released into production, and some reports are phased out over time. Wouldn’t it be great to have a way to keep track of the changes a report takes on in production over time? We’ll talk about how to keep track of change requests, how to analyze the utilization of existing reports, and how to track changes in users for the reports in production.</description>

      <title>Defeating the Limitations of the Query Optimizer</title>
      <description>Query optimizers are highly complex pieces of software, which even after 40 years of research, still face several technical challenges in some fundamental areas. As a result, there may be cases when even after you've provided the query optimizer with all the information it needs, you still don’t get an efficient execution plan for your queries. This session will show you the current challenges and limitations of query optimizers in general and the SQL Server query optimizer in particular, along with solutions or workarounds to avoid each of these problems.</description>

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

      <description>Does this sound like you? You were just given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA and could use a daily report. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it’s deployed. We’ll even look at the differences between building a report in BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) and Report Builder 3.0. We’ll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2012. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output. </description>

      <title>Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is 
deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is 
made up of a lot of objects in different environments. When you create an 
object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed 
into each environment. Together we will discover how to separate each 
object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have 
changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable 
deployment and version control process.</description>

      <title>Baseline,  Like a Boss</title>
      <description>When you are analyzing your database servers, how do you quantify performance gains or losses?  After you've made a change, do you wait for your users to tell you if things are better or worse?  Do you implement every “best practice” based on an author’s popularity?    Join Tim M. Hidalgo for a presentation on the why, how and “what then…” of baselining and the benefits of making informed decisions.</description>

      <title>Database Design: Size DOES Matter</title>
      <description>Great database performance starts with great database design. During the database design process it is important to select your datatypes wisely. The wrong choices will often lead to wasted space, increased response times, and less stability. Additionally you run the risk of having your design not scale as well as it should. Leave this session armed with the knowledge you need to help your databases perform at their peak efficiency. </description>

      <description>Have you ever taken over a server or better yet an entire environment?  Just recently I changed jobs knowing nothing about their databases except what I could learn from the interview process.  I walk in knowing there are going to be issues but where do I start?  What is most important, what can wait?  How can I get a picture of the systems?  Are there any tools to help me?  Let’s put our heads together, let’s see what you would do, then I will let you know what I have begun to do.</description>

      <title>Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL</title>
      <description>Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.</description>

      <title>Manageable SSAS Deployment Strategies</title>
      <description>When it comes to making changes to your production Analysis Services databases, do you simply open the SSAS DB in SQL Server Data Tools (or BIDS) and click through creating the changes? Does this method lead to problems keeping everything in sync and the right changes deployed to the right environment at the right time? Have you, the BI developer, had to fight to get Production access to do your own deployments?

If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, and are in search of a better way, I have the solution! In this demo-heavy session, we will look at five steps to more robust, controllable, and flexible Tabular and Multidimensional SSAS deployments.</description>

      <title>Turbo Charged SQL Development With SQL#</title>
      <description>Turbo charge your SQL Server development with the amazing SQL# CLR library.  We will do a quick overview of the SQL# library and then jump into examining a few real world implementations of some of the functions and procedures. Some examples will include string manipulation, file handling, as well as some RegEx usage. There are over 225 procedures and functions, user defined aggregates, and user defined types ... and counting. Come explore some of the interesting problems that SQL# can solve. If you'd like to download and view the CLR library ahead of the presentation, you can get most of the CLR features for free at www.sqlsharp.com.</description>

      <title>Trimming Indexes Getting Your Database In Shape</title>
      <description>Indexes are a wonderful thing.  We should be using them, and we should be maintaining them.  But over time our production databases start to look a little pudgy around the mid-section.  Maybe they are a little bloated with Unused Indexes, maybe they have Duplicate Indexes, and possibly even Reverse Indexes.  The first step to fixing these problems it so see if you have them, and if you do the second is to set about fixing them. You could be costing yourself CPU cycles, I/Op’s, and space and never even know it.</description>

      <title>The 10 Commandments of ETL</title>
      <description>ETL (Extract, Transform  Load) processes are fundamentally important in any data warehouse environment, and there are many different ways in which to develop the components.

In this session I will share the 10 basic principles I follow when developing ETL processes, and also show how the different choices can affect performance. Following these simple guidelines have resulted in many successful projects and happy customers. I'm sure it will work for you too!!</description>

      <title>Storage For the DBA</title>
      <description>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</description>

      <title>Designing and Loading Slowly Changing Dimensions</title>
      <description>Slowly Changing Dimensions form an integral part of any Data Warehouse environment, and there are many different factors that will determine the flexibility, scalability and effectiveness of the dimensional structure.

The first part of this session takes a look at all the different design elements and considerations of SCD's. We'll look at whether it is feasible to create a snowflake, how to deal with relationships between dimensions as well as 1:1 and many:many relationships with fact tables. 

Afterwards, we will walk through a practical and effective method (with code) to load SCD's with T-SQL.</description>

      <title>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</title>
      <description>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.</description>
