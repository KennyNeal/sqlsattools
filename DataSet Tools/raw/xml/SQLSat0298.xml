      <title>From S to 3XL: Implementing Data Partitioning and Tiered Storage</title>
      <description>Support of the large databases is not a trivial task. Large amount of data negatively impacts system performance and make administration and SLA compliance much more complicated. Data partitioning can help to solve those problems and reduce support and hardware cost. This session demonstrates various approaches of data partitioning available in SQL Server. It compares pros and cons of different partitioning techniques from performance, scalability and administration standpoints. The session also discusses how to reduce hardware cost by implementing tiered storage and demonstrates how to move data between filegroups and/or disk arrays keeping the system online in the different versions and editions of SQL Server. </description>

      <title>Putting Quality Back Into Your Data Analysis</title>
      <description>This session introduces Data Quality Services, a feature introduced in SQL Server 2012. One of the challenges in developing Business Intelligence solutions is ensuring that the data does not have inconsistencies, incomplete records, invalid or inaccurate values, and data duplication. Sometimes when consolidating data from more than one source you have to transform data to create one standard set of domain values in a standard format. SQL 2012 answers this need with Data Quality Services (DQS). In this session, you will learn the basics of what DQS is and how it can be used to clean your data. You will see how to build a domain both manually and from an existing data table. You will then see how to use these domains to validate tables in SQL Server and Excel preparing them for use in SSAS and PowerPivot. After this session, you will understand how by putting quality back into your data, you can be your organization's BI hero.</description>

      <description>Plan the work and work the plan. Are you doing that when it comes to your professional development? Few of us have a formal approach to professional development and that usually means it gets pushed down the list as other things in life happen. This session is designed to get you thinking about all aspects of your career and from there moves into a discussion about time and money - how much of each are you willing to spend to get where you want to go? At the end of this presentation you'll be ready for spend a couple quiet hours charting all the things you want to do, and then figuring out which ones you really want to do.</description>

      <title>So you think MDX is hard?</title>
      <description>A lot of people have this perception that MDX is difficult. It really isn't, when you understand what it is trying to accomplish under the hood. In this session we'll begin with a fundamental understanding of what MDX will do for you. Then we'll roll up our sleeves and dive into MDX code, starting from the simplest select statement and winding up building calculations you can put into your own SSAS Cubes.

      <description>Whether your a DBA or a developer, you will eventually need to write a query transforms XML data into rows and columns. It's there in client data feeds, files shipped from customers, and underneath the covers of SQL Server's own execution plans. The fact is, it's there, and you need query that data. In this session, we’ll explore some of the basic methods for querying XML through XQuery. By the end of the session you’ll be equipped with the tools and understanding needed to tear apart any XML like an old pro.</description>

      <title>Indexing your Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Rapid Data Warehouse Design and ETL</title>
      <description>Simply loading a data warehouse is only part of an ETL developers role. In this example driven session, Brian and Sherri will show you how to create and load a small data warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services. They will also show you how to make packages dynamic using variables and package configurations along with a few other "nice to have tricks" to include in your ETL arsenal. At the end of this session, you will be ready to take on the world. Well, maybe not the world, but you will know how to load a data warehouse.</description>

      <description>Attendees will learn how to define a permission set with a single script that allows your company’s DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate DBA permissions quickly to respond to production emergencies. 
DBAs will leave this session with an easy to implement, low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain the server but not be able to view user data. 
In addition, I’ll talk about our DBA’s real world experience with reduced permissions

      <title>Inside the Query Optimizer</title>
      <description>When it comes to SQL Server one of the biggest request you hear is “How can I make my Query Run FASTER!?”.  The answer understanding the first step in that process Is understanding the Query Optimizer.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.</description>
