      <description>I#39;m a DBA who has gone through most of my career with few people to learn and unsure of where to find great help until I found a real mentor.  When I started at a company with a great, knowledgeable manager and learned to find others speaking about SQL Server online my skills boomed.  This is especially true in my most passionate area, SQL Server performance.  

Knowing that my knowledge came from others, I now have a second passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</description>

      <description>Within the enterprise, the new Excel self-service tools can enable Power Users to define and create analytic requirements by creating new business models in PowerPivot. We will walk through a scenario of creating relationships, hierarchies, KPIs, calculations, and measures as a business person.  When completed we will hand it off the model to the governance board for review to see how it fits into the organization BI collateral.  Finally, we will put on our IT hats and convert the PowerPivot model into a SSAS Tabular version and give it enterprise strength of partitions and security.  We will end the session by selecting a deployment strategy that will meet the needs of new and existing models in the production environment.</description>

      <title>Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans</title>
      <description>Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

      <description>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</description>

      <description>You have more and more servers to manage and less time to accomplish everything. You're writing scripts to automate those tasks but they still take time to run. PowerShell remoting allows you to manage servers without the overhead of Remote Desktop, and allows you to run processes on all your servers simultaneously.  In this session we'll walk through how PowerShell remoting works, how to set it up, and how you can save time getting things done more quickly.</description>

Components to handle logging and errors or even a standard workflow for loading data files.  In this session I’ll show you how you can create standard templates that already contain any and all of the common components you desire.  We’ll also look at how to implement and use these templates so that the next time you create a SSIS package you can spend your time on the work you actually need to do instead of implementing common components over and over again.</description>

      <title>APPLY Yourself</title>
      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>

      <description>Let's face it, auditing isn't fun. But if you're a DBA, you need to know what's going on in your SQL Server instance. Fortunately, SQL Audit makes it easy. In this session, we'll cover what you can and can't audit using SQL Audit, enhancements in 2012, configuring database and server audits, ways to process output, and ideas for how to implement SQL Audit on a larger scale. Auditing doesn't have to be hard. And with the help of a little custom coding, it can even be fun.

      <description>Database administrators as a rule hate Row-By-Agonizing-Row (RBAR) solutions due to how poorly they perform in T-SQL. Sometimes, though, it seems as though we need to make do and take that performance hit. This presentation will show you that the humble tally table can eliminate RBAR-dependency across a number of different problem spaces, including splitting text, validating dates, and even reporting on errors. With plenty of examples, you'll get to see exactly how powerful a tally table can be.</description>

      <title>Unit Testing SQL Server</title>
      <description>In the nearly 20 years I have been working with SQL Server, most of that as an independent consultant, I can count on two hands the number of clients I have come across that had ANY database tests constructed.  I can count on TWO FINGERS the number of them that had repeatable database tests.  Even the most ardent Agile/Scrum/pick-your-new-and-shiny-development-mantra shops hardly ever do anything more than wave a magic wand at testing the database, because it can be REALLY HARD to do and do correctly.  In this session we will cover examples of why repeatable database testing is CRITICALLY important and then examine both a free and a low-cost commercial product to ease the pain and improve developer efficiency.</description>

      <title>Transactional Replication-10 steps for successful implementation</title>
      <description>What is potentially our biggest problem with transactional replication? You guessed it...it breaks! It may break for a variety of reasons and we as DBA’s probably have experienced them all at one point or another. Our biggest worry? Bringing replication back online whenever a full snapshot reinitialization is not an option due to time or space concerns. But don't you worry; we have a couple of tricks up our sleeves! During this session, we will go over options available to you to re-sync your replication with minimal downtime for your production environments.</description>

      <title>Exposing SQL data with SharePoint</title>
      <description>You've got your data, but accessing it means using one application among dozens, which can be difficult for once-in-a-while users. Alternatively, you can make the data to SharePoint where it can be easily searched, related, and even (securely) exposed for integration via the SharePoint native OData, REST, and WCF interfaces.</description>

      <title>All About the SSIS Catalog (SSISDB)</title>
      <description>Wow, deployment of SSIS packages in SQL Server 2012 is radically different, when the new SSIS catalog is used (“Who Moved My Cheese?”). This session examines the “new” SSISDB, its architecture and functionality and compares that to the “old” method of Package Configurations in previous versions of SSIS. </description>

      <title>SSIS for the Absolute Beginner</title>
      <description>Absolutely an understatement, SSIS is a very powerful construction set for moving and processing data and performing a huge variety of tasks. This session will explore the basics of SSIS development, architecture, and terminology, so that you’ll know Control Flow v. Data Flow, Tasks v. Components, Precedence Constraints v. Data Flow pipeline, to explore the types of problems SSIS can address and be able to develop basic SSIS workflows.</description>

      <title>Indexing Fundamentals</title>
      <description>A solid understanding of clustered and nonclustered indexes and a thorough look at their costs and benefits.  This will include looking in execution plans to see how indexes are used, going through the buffer cache to see the memory costs and benefits, and a complete look at how they fit into a strategy to improve page life expectancy and server performance. </description>
