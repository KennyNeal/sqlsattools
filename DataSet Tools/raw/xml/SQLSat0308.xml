      <title>Mind your IO: Resource Governor shows you How</title>
      <description>Resource Governor was introduced in SQL Server 2008 to achieve predictable performance in a multi-tenant environment, to support mixed workload patterns, to provide mechanisms and tools to deal with runaway queries, and to enforce resource limits for CPU and memory. In prior releases, there have been incremental enhancements to this feature. SQL Server 2014 now supports resource governance for IO. In this demo-heavy session, you will learn to implement Resource Governor to configure resource limits in a comprehensive manner including IO and guarantee predictable performance for different tenants. Along the way, you are also going to see enhancements to Extended Events framework and disk specific counters that have been added SQLServer:Resource Pool Stats.</description>

      <title>Enhancing your career: Building your personal brand</title>
      <description>In three years I went from a complete unknown to a popular blogger, speaker at PASS Summit, and a SQL Server MVP.  Along the way I saw my yearly income triple.  Is it because I know some secret?  Is it because I am a genius?  No!  It is just about laying out your career path, setting goals, and doing the work.  It's about building your personal brand and stepping out of your comfort zone.  It's about overcoming your fear of taking risks.  If you can do those things, you will be rewarded.  I will discuss how you too can go from unknown to well-known.  I will talk about building your community presence by blogging, presenting, writing articles and books, twitter, LinkedIn, certifications, interviewing, networking, and consulting and contracting.  Your first step to enhancing your career will be to attend this session!</description>

      <title>Table Partitioning: the Secret Weapon for your Big Data Problems.</title>
      <description>Is big data starting to slow you down? Is data growth putting your maintenance tasks in danger of not meeting your service level agreements? Do you wish you could archive old data with minimal impact to your tables during the archive process? Do you wish you could eliminate the majority of the data in your tables when you query them? If so, its time you consider implementing table partitioning to help with your general performance and to reduce your maintenance window for completing your maintenance tasks. In this session you will learn how table partitioning works and when it should be implemented. You will be able to understand how to initially configure partition functions and partition schemes to have a rock solid partitioned table. Finally, you will learn how to implement an automated sliding window to maintain your partitioned tables for ensuring optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Ah, ha, how do you automate database administration?</title>
      <description>A typical enterprise database environment comprise of hundreds of database server hosts. Each host has at least the following database administrator's tasks:

	User database full backup
	System database full backup
	Transaction Log backup
	Check database integrity
	Index defragmentation and update statistics
	Backup cleanup per retention policy
	Backup history and agent history cleanup

	Quick N Easy recovery strategy

SQL Server native environment, the maintenance plan, is not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios and is not friendly enough to debug. While CMS environment is great, it is not possible to automate via User Graphical Interface.
I use CMS, T-SQL and Powershell custom solution to construct a worry-free, stable, easy-deploy DBA task plan and automated monitoring alert notifications including backup failure, backup reports and sql agent job failure.
These maybe the processes that future SQL Server version could incorporate as a standard.

      <title>Top 5 Ways to Write Effective triggers</title>
      <description>You've got a piece of code that you want to implement as a trigger, but you've read that triggers can grind your performance to a halt. Developers everywhere write triggers to implement business logic, to enforce certain types of constraints, or to avoid changing database schema or external code. Many triggers are inefficient and violate best practices -- but it doesn't have to be this way. Come learn how to improve your triggers and keep them off the list of potential scapegoats for your SQL Server performance woes.</description>

      <title>Windows Azure SQL Database Design: Concepts and Trade-offs</title>
      <description>Data modelers and designers need to understand the logical, physical, and technical differences in designing for Windows Azure SQL Databases (WASDs) and traditional on-premise SQL Server databases. In this session, we'll review the concepts that still work in both and the features that need to be tailored to each target environment.

You’ll see demonstrations of the database creation and initial design processes and gain best practices for model-driven development for each environment, including tool support. We’ll finish up with 5 tips for designing databases for both WASD and SQL Server.</description>

      <title>The Lost Science of Set Theory and Relational Algebra</title>
      <description>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.).  As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries.  In this session, we will review the basics of set theory, relational algebra and how they apply to database development to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.</description>

      <title>Mission Possible: Interactive Performance Troubleshooting - Indexes</title>
      <description>Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!</description>

      <title>Speed, Depth  Flexibility - Having it all with real-time SSAS</title>
      <description>SSAS is traditionally implemented in a batch-oriented architecture that requires a nightly maintenance window for processing data. As such, it doesn't get much consideration as an option to satisfy high speed, near-time use cases. However, with some well-placed customization of a few components of a standard OLAP architecture, SSAS can achieve near real-time data latency. This can be a game-changer for businesses that operate around the clock and don't have the luxury of a refresh window, as well as for users who need to analyze both historical and intraday numbers to make decisions.

      <title>Best Practices to Deliver BI Solutions</title>
      <description>If your company is planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution, you need to be aware that BI projects have high failure rates. Gartner says between 70% to 80% of corporate business intelligence projects fail. And with “big data” adding more complexity you can expect even more failures. However, the major causes of these failures are well known and can be avoided by implementing a set of best practices.

I have worked on dozens of end-to-end BI projects and have seen my share of successes and failures. I will talk about the reasons BI projects fail and share best practices and lessons learned so your BI project will fall into the “successful” category.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Database Performance Problem Blame Game </title>
      <description>If you’re like most DBAs, you probably can’t even count the number of times others have blamed your databases for an application performance issue – not that you’d want to know that number. Maybe the root cause of a problem did originate in the database, but maybe it didn’t. It can be difficult to tell – especially when communication among the application, storage, virtualization, and database teams isn’t in perfect sync. Getting the true full picture of the entire environment is a challenge that just about every DBA faces, and native tools do little to help; they generally require a lot of manual work and may still fail to reveal the source of the problem at all.

You’ll learn tricks to:
•Understand normal (baseline) behavior
•Compare database query workloads over different time ranges
•Understand the performance impact of system and database change
•Monitor more than just the database
•Extend database performance data to other teams</description>

      <title>Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is 
deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is 
made up of a lot of objects in different environments. When you create an 
object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed 
into each environment. Together we will discover how to separate each 
object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have 
changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable 
deployment and version control process.</description>

      <description>Are you confident that your application performs as expected on Leap Day?  Do you know how long it would take to run out of identity values in your major tables?  Can you support case-sensitive collations and non-standard sort orders?  If not, odds are good that you are not edge and corner testing your application.  In this session, learn how to define the edges of your application and start to stretch those boundaries by setting up challenging test and development environments.  For database administrators, learn what configurations in your environment may be a source of bugs in application code and what you can do about it.

      <title>SSIS project deployments with multiple developers</title>
      <description>Before SQL Server 2012, it was easy to develop several SSIS packages in a project and deploy each package as you complete it.  However SQL Server 2012 introduces the project deployment model.  With its awesome features comes the limitation that you can no longer deploy a single package.  You must deploy the whole project every time!  How do you deploy a project that contains a mix of deployed packages, ready to deploy packages and packages in development?

In this session I demonstrate common problems that arise in the package development lifecycle that affect project deployment.  I will then demonstrate how to use Team Foundation Server to address these problems.  I will develop the story for handling packages at various stages of development using TFS.

      <title>Scripting in SSIS</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integration Services is full of useful and versatile tasks, components, and containers that allow the ETL developer to easily handle most data movement and transformation issues. However, it's not uncommon to run into ETL need that require more flexibility than what is offered in the native tools of SSIS. Fortunately, Integration Services comes with a couple of tools to overcome most any ETL challenge: the Script Task and the Script Component.

In this session, we will explore both the Script Task and Script Component tools within SSIS. We will discuss the reasons why one might need to include scripting as part of an ETL strategy, as well as examining some use cases where scripting is a good fit. We will follow up with several demonstrations of how to solve specific ETL challenges using the Script Task and Script Component in SSIS.</description>

      <title>Attributes  Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012</title>
      <description>The session explains Attributes and Hierarchies in Analysis Services 2012 Semantic Model. They are used to slice (filter) and dice (group) measures and dimensions used to view analytical data.  The slicing and dicing of data involves fields, columns, or whatever you want to labeled them. But, in SQL Server Semantic model these are called Attributes and Hierarchies. The configuration of these slicers and dicers are important in SQL Server Analysis Services. This session will demonstrate the difference between an attribute and columns in a hierarchy in the dimension as well as the configuration of these for best performance and viewing.

      <title>SQL Server Agent: The life preserver for the drowning DBA</title>
      <description>Automation is a key part to becoming a great DBA.  Without automation a DBA can start to drown in a sea of repeating tasks.   The SQL Server Agent can serve as the much-needed life preserver to pull your head above the water.  

In this session you will learn at how to setup the SQL Agent as well as creating jobs and alerts within the agent to help you with daily, monthly, yearly tasks.   

In addition we will look into how to monitor the jobs and alerts created.  Lastly we will talk about some common pitfalls to watch out for when dealing with the SQL Server Agent.</description>

      <title>How Active Directory affects SQL Server</title>
      <description>If you have ever had a Kerberos or SSPI context error, then you won't want to miss this session.  SQL Server has a large surface area and Active Directory can influence a big part of it.  I will discuss AD DNS configuration, Group Policy Objects, Kerberos (of course), and how all of them affect your SQL Server.  By the end of the session you'll have a check list of things to discuss with your domain administrator when you return to work.</description>

      <title>DIY Performance Reporting</title>
      <description>Stop relying on vendors to provide you with performance data.  Between Windows and SQL Server you’ve already got all you need to collect and report on server performance.  And it’s far more flexible than you’ll ever get from a vendor.  This is often called a poor man’s method, but it’s so much more than that.  I’m going to show you what your options are for collecting performance data for free and you’ll even walk away with a framework you can plug into your own environment and start using tomorrow with very little effort.</description>

Change Tracking is now the red-headed step child, but in many cases may be a better solution for data ETL movement from an OLTP database to a data warehouse database.  This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos.  It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos.</description>

      <description>Windowing functions were first introduced in SQL Server 2005 when the ranking functions were added. SQL Server 2012 offers analytic functions that greatly simplify the coding of complex problems. Using analytic functions, aggregations can be easily and painlessly combined with row level details. FIRST_VALUE, RANGE, LEAD, and LAG introduce new ways of thinking about and solving problems. We'll go through the data and the new operators to reduce formerly complex queries to simpler ones.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?</title>
      <description>For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.</description>

      <title>T-SQL Code Sins </title>
      <description>It’s impossible to follow every best practice all the time. “Code sins” are those things we do to our code that are either so horrendous that they can’t be borne, or that have such tremendous consequences that your stored procedures wish they’d never been created. Attendees will hear about the most common code sins that make code difficult to read, support, run and extend, and practical strategies for reversing the trend.</description>

      <title>Introduction to BIML and BIMLScript</title>
      <description>Microsoft has provided some great tools for creating and editing SSIS packages.  First Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) then SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).  However, when creating an SSIS package you frequently repeat the same steps over and over.  BIML is an XML markup language designed for representing the structure of an SSIS package.  BIML Script takes that structure and generates an SSIS package.In this session we will use BIDS Helper to create a simple SSIS package using BIML.  We will handle a couple SSIS scenarios with BIML and BIML Script.  </description>

      <title>15 Quick Tips for SSIS Performance</title>
      <description>When reviewing your ETL processes, the No. 1 question is always, "Does it work as expected?" Closely following that question is the ubiquitous, "How fast does it run?" This session’s tips are targeted at improve the latter.

In this session, we’ll focus on SSIS package performance, quickly reviewing 15 common hotspots for performance issues as well as recommended methods for maximizing throughput. You’ll walk away with some key design patterns and recommendations that you can use today to improve SSIS package performance.</description>

      <title>Storage For the DBA</title>
      <description>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</description>

      <title>SQL Watchdog -  find out instantly when SQL changes in production</title>
      <description>Almost everyone's seen it happen - problems due to changes, be it SPs, index rebuilds, or even configuration changes. But what if you could look historically and track down what changes were made when, by who, and from where? What if you could see in realtime when changes occur?  It exists, it's built into SQL Server standard edition from 2005-2014, and it's easy to implement. Come learn what Event Notification is and why you'll want it in your environment. This is not theory, all code provided and in production on hundreds of servers in multiple environments.

      <title>Taming the T-Log</title>
      <description>This session will give a brief overview of the many facets of the transaction log.  Explore how the different recovery models play into the behavior of the transaction log.  We will see what taking the different types of backups do to the transaction log.  Explore alerts and scripts to monitor the transaction log.  We will explore all this to hopefully help us tame our transaction logs, or at least to better understand why it is the way it is.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Columnstore Indexes--Make Your Data Warehouse Fly </title>
      <description>Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012, along with a new type of query processing "batch mode". In SQL 2014 they get even better--we can use a Columnstore index as a clustered index and update it. In this session we will explore the basics and beyond of Columnstore indexes and how they can help your warehouse performance. We will also examine their impact to insert and update performance, and the best use cases for implementation.</description>

      <title>45 min to build your first SSRS report</title>
      <description>Does this sound like you? You were just given access to SSRS and you want to make a report. Or, you're a DBA and could use a daily report. Either way, I've got your back! You will learn everything you need to know to get that first report out the door quickly and how to tweak it once it’s deployed. We’ll even look at the differences between building a report in BIDS (Business Intelligence Development Studio) and Report Builder 3.0. We’ll use SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) 2012. The query makes no difference, this time it's all about the output. </description>
