      <title>INDEXING 101 - WHAT IS AN INDEX?</title>
      <description>If your eyes glaze over when you read the terms 'clustered index' or 'non-clustered index', and you think you really ought to know what these are, this may just be the session for you.

This session is designed for those new to database design/development. If you have some idea of how databases and tables are used, but need a (re)grounding in the basic concepts of indexing and how to use them to your advantage, you will benefit from this session. You will leave knowing what a clustered index is, what a non-clustered index is, when to use them, how to use them, their advantages and disadvantages. We will start at a very high level with simple examples and basic definitions, and then go into details of how indexes work and practical examples of index usage in T-SQL.</description>

      <title>Parent/Child Structures in SSIS</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integration Services provides the ability to nest packages within one another in a parent/child structure.  By creating a multilayer package infrastructure using native elements of SSIS, you can easily encapsulate reusable components of your ETL layer, simplify logging, and make the development process more efficient.

In this session, we'll take a tour through parent/child design architecture within SSIS.  We'll discuss the advantages of using the parent/child architecture while reviewing various design patterns.  We'll review the capabilities within the various versions of SSIS (2005 through 2014) and discuss the buttons and switches that make it work.  Finally, we'll have a number of realistic demonstrations to fully illustrate these concepts.</description>

      <title>Design and Implement BI like Edison! </title>
      <description>As the most prolific inventor in American history, Thomas Edison was a master of “Best Practices!” Edison’s creations were not just novel and commercially successful, but many launched entire new industries including electric light and power, sound recording, motion pictures and industrial cement and concrete manufacture. At the heart of Edison’s remarkable record of innovation was his categorization of the innovation process into “competencies,” or bundles of skills supporting the achievement of success in a particular area of endeavor.  In this session, we will look at ways that we can use many of these broad success secrets to bring powerful tools and strategies to the recurring implementation of business intelligence.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Storage internals: Looking under the hood.</title>
      <description>Ever wonder what goes on under the hood of your SQL Servers? SQL Server is a complicated system. Understanding how your data is actually stored on disk can have a profound effect on the choices you make while designing and architecting a solution. In this session I'll show you how data is physically stored and how choices you make effect performance. We'll look at the structure of rows and data pages, index allocation maps, and the physical differences between heaps and clustered indexes.</description>

      <description>With the introduction of Power BI, Microsoft has moved one step closer to its vision of self-service BI for all.  But with this new offering comes a bevy of "Power" apps that are bound to confuse just about anyone.  In this session, we will power through Power BI for Office 365 bringing meaning to the mess of names like Power Query, Power Map, Power Pivot and Power View and how these experiences are delivered through Microsoft Excel and Office 365.  Expect to leave with the power of insight into an exciting new offering that captures the essence of self-service BI.</description>

      <title>Converting Unreliable Deployments Into Consistent Releases</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is 
deployed in the wrong order or the incorrect version. Each database is 
made up of a lot of objects in different environments. When you create an 
object like a table or stored procedure, you need to get this object deployed 
into each environment. Together we will discover how to separate each 
object for proper order deployment while releasing only objects which have 
changed. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will provide a reliable 
deployment and version control process.</description>

      <title>Source Code Control: Revision management for the data dude.</title>
      <description>Ever wanted to see what has changed since the last time you looked, or work with someone else and realize you've both changed the same stored procedure?   Do you really enjoy searching through folder after folder of obscure .sql files to find the query you might or might not have saved last week?  There is a better way, and it doesn't have to be a hassle.  In this session we'll look at why you would want a revision management system and options (build or buy, free or fee) to implement one for yourself or your team. </description>

      <title>Change Tracking:  A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control</title>
      <description>Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture.  Change Tracking is now the red-headed step child, but in many cases may be a better solution for data ETL movement from an OLTP database to a data warehouse database.  This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos.  It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos.</description>

      <title>DIY Performance Reporting</title>
      <description>Stop relying on vendors to provide you with performance data.  Between Windows and SQL Server you’ve already got all you need to collect and report on server performance.  And it’s far more flexible than you’ll ever get from a vendor.  This is often called a poor man’s method, but it’s so much more than that.  I’m going to show you what your options are for collecting performance data for free and you’ll even walk away with a framework you can plug into your own environment and start using tomorrow with very little effort.</description>

      <title>SQL Watchdog -  find out instantly when SQL changes in production</title>
      <description>Almost everyone's seen it happen - problems due to changes, be it SPs, index rebuilds, or even configuration changes. But what if you could look historically and track down what changes were made when, by who, and from where? What if you could see in realtime when changes occur?  It exists, it's built into SQL Server standard edition from 2005-2014, and it's easy to implement. Come learn what Event Notification is and why you'll want it in your environment. This is not theory, all code provided and in production on hundreds of servers in multiple environments.

      <description>ColumnStore indexes were first introduced as xVelocity with SQL 2012 as a way to improve query performance against large data sets by grouping and storing columns of data instead of rows.  With SQL 2014, those ColumnStore indexes become update-able.   In this session, we review the difference in ColumnStore indexes, implementing ColumnStore indexes Clustered and Non-Clustered and monitor performance.</description>
