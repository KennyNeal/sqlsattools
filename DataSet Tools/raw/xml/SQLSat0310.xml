      <title>The Irish Economic Crisis Visualised with Power BI</title>
      <description>In this session we will explore the Irish Economic Crisis from multiple perspectives, using Microsoft’s latest Visualisation tools including Power BI, Power Query, Power Map, Power View and SharePoint”.   It starts from a very common business angle, where people need to make sense of data, fast, but don't know what questions to ask, nor how to combine available sources in a way that makes sense.   This session converts the Irish Economic crisis into a story that can be explored in an interactive way, using familiar tools, in a way that people may feel should have been noticed in the run-up to the crisis. Come by to find out what led to a small country owing over 200 billion euro and if Power BI could have helped.   Come and find out where all the money came from and what Ireland spent it on!</description>

      <title>First steps in continuous integration for databases with Red Gate’s SQL Automation Pack.</title>
      <description>At previous SQL Saturday Dublin events, you’ve seen how easy it is to get your SQL Server databases in source control.
In this session, we’ll build on this foundation and look at the resources you can use to set up an automated build process for your databases.
Starting with a database that’s source controlled using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control, we’ll use the SQL Automation Pack and Team City to set up a simple build process that runs every time you commit a change.
You’ll see how this process helps you spot and fix errors quicker, and how you can use it to produce an artefact you can use for reliable, repeatable deployments in the future.
One lucky session attendee will also win a license of the SQL Automation Pack during this session, so don’t miss out!

      <title>Learning Entity Framework 6</title>
      <description>Microsoft has clearly positioned the Entity Framework 6 (EF) as the primary data access platform for .NET applications. But many developers have yet to embrace the powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities that EF offers. Whether you’re new to ORM, or you’ve dabbled in other ORM technologies, Lenni will show how quickly you can start working with EF6 and boost your productivity when building data-centric .NET applications.

We’ll begin with a quick introduction to ORM and EF, and then explain many of the special ORM features in EF6, such as the Entity Data Model, and table splitting, inheritance, entity splitting, and many-to-many relationships. With the basics covered, Lenni will then dive right into live demos that show what EF can do for you as a data access layer, using database-first, model-first, and code-first approaches with both direct SQL and stored procedures. We’ll also discuss new features introduced in EF6, and show how to use EF in N-Tier scenarios.</description>

      <title>Storing of sensitive data in SQL Server - Meeting the PCI Data Security Standards </title>
      <description>Your business needs to process credit card data and you need to store it somewhere.

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that you store the data in an encrypted form and make sure your processes are robust to protect the data. These requirements are the PCI Data Security Standards currently at version 3.0 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pcidss_agreement.php?association=pcidss 
 
If you want to use SQL Server as your data store what do you need to do?
 This session covers the following for SQL Server 
* Encrypting data in SQL Server
* Meeting Key management requirements of 
* Detect and audit access to the data
* Retro fitting encryption of data into an existing application

 We will do an overview of all the areas and drill down into the storage of data and how that can be achieved seamlessly from the application.
At the end of the session you will know what you need to do, to be able store card details in SQL Server and achieve PCI certificatio</description>

      <title>SQOOP - Taking relational data to Hadoop and back again</title>
      <description>SQOOP or SQL to Hadoop is a tool in the Hadoop ecosystem that lets you take your "SQL" data and put it into Hadoop or vice versa.  The use cases are numerous.  You can have Hadoop perform the heavy lifting using Map Reduce and then use SQOOP to take the results and put them in "SQL".  You can have Hadoop act as your Data Warehouse and use SQOOP to do your daily loads from your relational DB into Hadoop.
SQOOP is a command line tool but don't let that put you off.  
This session will look at SQOOP and the plethora of options available to you on the command line.  If you want to learn about SQOOP then this is the session for you.

      <title>A One Hour Data Analysts Toolkit: using R and PowerBI</title>
      <description>If you want to conduct advanced Business Intelligence development and Business Analysis, then it is useful to understand data visualisation and have R as a tool in your toolset. In this intensive one hour session, we will look at the latest suite of Microsoft Business Intelligence tools - Microsoft Power BI in conjunction with R. The demos will be implemented in both tools in an end-to-end hour long session so that delegates can see when to use each technology in order to determine 'what to use' and 'when to use it', as well as seeing where the technologies complement each other. We will visualise the data according to data visualisation principles set out by Stephen Few amongst others.</description>

      <title>Replication Troubleshooting  Monitoring</title>
      <description>Replication is a powerful feature that has long been available in SQL Server.  However, with great power come great headaches! Replication normally runs happily once set up, but if things go wrong it can turn into a seemingly never ending list of errors.  In this session I will dig into how replication can go wrong (and has gone wrong for me) and what steps you can take to fix these issues.  Along the way I will go into what monitoring options you have when working with replication and also a couple of gotchas that have caught me out in the past.</description>

      <title>Shared technical learnings for building highly scalable and available cloud application</title>
      <description>The Azure CAT team has successfully architected, designed and built over 200 cloud projects. In this session we will share the learnings on how to design a cloud application to scale to handle large, complex workloads. We will have a special focus on the telemetry management and monitoring requirements such large systems require.  Building cloud applications are different than building on premise SQL Server applications. Agenda I) Share some of the existing successful cloud deployment feeds and speeds. II) The challenges we faced III) It is all about the architecture up front IV) Lessons Learned V) Summary QA.</description>

      <title>Digging Into the .Net SqlClient</title>
      <description>The prevailing opinion is that the optimizations for SQL Server are usually only done on the server itself. But is there anything we can do on the client to gain more speed? In this session aimed at .Net and SQL developers, we'll dive into the workings of the .Net SqlClient and give you insight into way more than just SqlCommand.ExecuteReader() and SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery().</description>

      <title>Windows Azure SQL Database Design: Concepts and Trade-offs</title>
      <description>Data modelers and designers need to understand the logical, physical, and technical differences in designing for Windows Azure SQL Databases (WASDs) and traditional on-premise SQL Server databases. In this session, we'll review the concepts that still work in both and the features that need to be tailored to each target environment.

You’ll see demonstrations of the database creation and initial design processes and gain best practices for model-driven development for each environment, including tool support. We’ll finish up with 5 tips for designing databases for both WASD and SQL Server.</description>

      <title>SQL anti patterns</title>
      <description>You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.</description>

      <title>MDX 101</title>
      <description>Give your queries a multidimensional makeover. In this session we'll look at the structure and basics of MDX, the Multi Dimensional query eXpression language for querying Analysis Services OLAP cubes.

We'll start at the beginning, so you need no previous MDX experience, but it does help to understand what a cube is.
Learn the difference between a member, measure, tuple, set and dimension. Well describe how to decypher a [] from a {} or (). We'll look at examples of each, and show how you can easily access the imense power of cubes with relative ease.</description>

      <title>Storage for the DBA</title>
      <description>Storage can be one of the biggest bottlenecks when it comes to database performance.  It's also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we'll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We'll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as the storage configuration.</description>

      <title>DBAs are from Mars,  SharePoint admins are from Ve</title>
      <description>SharePoint databases are considered a black box - touch them and you lose support. Furthermore, SharePoint leaves an unintelligible track of database names and GUIDs on your server. They are supposed to scale, but how and how much? Here are some techniques DBAs should be aware of to optimize SharePoint performance and scalability. This demo-packed session, based on real-life experiences, will show you how to tune your SQL Server for SharePoint and how to customize your SharePoint installation so that it fits your IT conventions, not the other way around.</description>

      <title>How to write professional Powershell scripts</title>
      <description>You probably have a few Powershell scripts sitting around, perhaps written from scratch but most likely you borrowed the idea from a blog somewhere, and then used those as templates to achieve your goal. It's time to take those ad-hoc scripts turn them into your very own module. And while we're at it we might as well add proper error handling, parameterization and pipeline support. I will also demonstrate how to build help, force and whatif support.
This is a demo rich session and all demos will be covering practical SQL Server related solutions.</description>

      <title>Using Power BI and SharePoint as a rapid development BI Strategy</title>
      <description>See how you can use Excel and SharePoint to quickly implement a BI solution with Power BI. The Power BI tools allow you to extract, transform and load your data (Power Query), model that data (Power Pivot) and visualise the resulting analyses (Power View and Power Map) all within Excel. The results can be shared simply in the cloud with Office365 SharePoint Online. If you’re ready for the next level you can migrate your model to SQL Server Analysis Services on-premise or stick with the cloud using Azure Virtual Machines.</description>
