      <title>Deadlocks. Everything that developer needs to know</title>
      <description>It's no secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. This is an exceptional situation, when two concurrent queries request same resources, but in a different order. Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunatelly in real life deadlocks can be more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: " You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". So we should deal with them. The algorythm is following: catch, analyze, fix. The most challenging and interesting here is the analysis part. Once you understand why it was occured, you can fix it. In this session we will focus on the analysis of complex,</description>

In a first step the transition to Geodata is presented in the form of longitude and latitude. The question of data source and data quality is also an issue addressed in this section. The next step deals with the selection of appropriate maps. Of special note is the data-matching of the maps with the address data. Also the own production of map sections will be illustrated in an example. The third step is to conduct the use and configuration of the control and the reference to the report data</description>

      <title>A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management  </title>
      <description>As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined</description>

      <description>There are a lot of questions about statistics that I receive in my trainings, projects and during my sessions: Why I have to rebuild statistics, if my auto-update stats option in ON. Why I still have bad plans or high CPU usage? Should I disable it or use full scan instead?
We usually rely on auto-update stats database options and sometimes perform a regular stats updates additionally in order to be sure that the QP has an up to date info about our table data. But there are some specific cases when those thinks just don’t help and even recompiling don’t boost the performance of a query. Let me list and explain for you some statistics updates exceptions cases and you will understand how to proper manage your statistics in order to gain max from them.</description>

      <description>Why Upgrade?
This is the big question that every SQL Server user will be asking, from my experience I say not just for shiny new features but increase your productivity and do-more with-less practices.
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008.
In this session, we will overview end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading SQL Server 2000, 2005,  2008 R2  SQL Server 2012 (with a good overview on 2014 too) by using best practices and available resources. We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution is offered.</description>

      <title>Data Warehouse Design and Best Practices</title>
      <description>A data warehouse is a database designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing. An appropriate design leads to scalable, balanced and flexible architecture that is capable to meet both present and long-term future needs. This session covers a comparison of the main data warehouse architectures together with best practices for the logical and physical design that support staging, load and querying.
Join this session to learn various architectural approaches our team evaluated for a 50’000+ hours EU project.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Temporal Queries</title>
      <description>Having a SQL Server solution for a problem does not mean the job is done. Of course, the next immediate issue is the performance. Temporal queries that involve intervals are typically very IO and CPU intensive. For example, a test for overlapping intervals was solved with inefficient queries for years. However, a handful of solutions with fast queries was developed lately. This high-level technical session introduces five different methods to get efficient queries that search for overlapping intervals. Of course, these solutions can be implemented on other temporal problems as well. Actually, the test for overlapping intervals is one of the most complex temporal problems.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Text with SQL Server 2014</title>
      <description>Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media.
Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with SQL Server tools.</description>

      <title>No more waiting – an introduction to SQL Server wait statistics</title>
      <description>When you are standing in line at the grocery store you know exactly what you’re waiting for, paying the things you intend to buy. In SQL Server things aren’t usually so simple and many times you have to wait for more than only the length of the queue or the speed of the cashier. Thankfully SQL Server gathers the exact time you have been waiting and what resource you have been waiting on. In this session we will take a look at how SQL Server gathers this information and how it can help you identify, troubleshoot and proactively solve performance issues.</description>

      <title>Indexing for denormalization</title>
      <description>What has the biggest impact on SQL Server overall performance? Hardware, SQL Server configuration or maybe query tuning? No, none of those frequently discussed options. They are important, but the single, most important factor is the database design.
A third normal form is great, but sometime a database really should be denormalized to gain a performance boost. This is where indices shine. During this session you will see: how important a proper table design can be, when to use indices on computed columns and why they are way better than triggers, how to create useful indexed views and how to asses their costs and benefits.
