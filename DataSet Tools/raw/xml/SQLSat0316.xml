      <title>(Unusual) Problem solving with SSIS scripts</title>
      <description>Every once in a while a client will have an unusual or obscure requirement that is either very difficult or not possible to satisfy with the out of the box tools provided by SSIS.  
What do you do when your data sources aren’t predictable or in a format not easily read by standard SSIS adapters?
This is when scripting “#8 fencing wire” of SSIS really comes to the fore.
During this session we’ll explore and solve some interesting real life scenarios with SSIS scripts.

      <title>Metadata Driven SSIS With Biml</title>
      <description>The power of BimlScript is amplified by the availability of rich metadata to drive the automation of your SSIS solution.  Peter will demonstrate a flexible and reusable framework for storing and managing the metadata that you will use as an input to your BimlScripts. The framework demonstrated will be made available to all attendees and can be used with the free BidsHelper Visual Studio add in. </description>

      <title>Real-World Biml Framework (Yours For The Taking)</title>
      <description>Following on from the Metadata driven session Peter will introduce BimlScript transformers and show how they can be used, either interactively or as part of an automatically applied framework. Topics will include transformer syntax, merge modes, target types, execution options, and transformer layering. Peter will also show you how you can enforce these patterns using validators that ensure best practices within your enterprise. This session focus on more advanced Biml features available in Varigence Mist.

      <description>SARGability is such a significant thing in the database world, and goes far beyond "Keep your columns on the left and functions on the right". In this talk, you'll be able learn principles that will affect not only how easily your data can be located, but also the way that joins are performed and more. You can even learn ways to tune poorly performing queries without having to rewrite anything.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014</title>
      <description>Since November 2013, Kiwibank has had SQL Server 2014 running live in Production, despite it only going RTM in April 2014. This session will go over the pros and cons of deploying a pre-release version and also cover some of the things that we did do, didn't do and couldn't do. This deployment is fully supported by Microsoft and I'll share some of the background info on that too. This session will be a beginner to intermediate with some advanced aspects as well.

      <title>ETL Architecture for Solving Data Warehouse Challenges</title>
      <description>Data Warehouses are heavily in use nowadays in most of businesses around the world. Data Warehousing brings higher performance, faster and more insightful data analysis out of operational databases. By the way there are some challenges in design and implementing Data Warehouses which needs robust and reliable ETL implementation. In this session you will learn an ETL Architecture implemented by SSIS and MDS to solve couple of most challengeable Data Warehousing scenarios which are Slowly Changing Dimension and Inferred Dimension Member. There will be many demos through this session which helps you to understand design and implementation of the architecture.</description>
