      <title>Generate SSIS packages automatically with Biml and BimlScript</title>
      <description>SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating the actual SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. There are no easy ways to handle metadata and schema changes, and if there are new requirements you might have to go through all the packages one more time.

It's time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself principle to SSIS development. In this session I will use the free BIDS Helper add-in to show you the basics of Biml and BimlScript, how to generate SSIS packages automatically from databases and flat files, how easy those packages can be changed, and how to move common code to separate files that can be included where needed. See why they say Biml allows you to complete in a day what once took more than a week!</description>

      <title>PowerShell for Data Professionals</title>
      <description>You’ve heard it said, “If you have to do it twice, automate it.” Cut the learning curve and get a real handle on this powerful automation tool. This session walks you through a dozen scripts to simplify and easily automate time-consuming and tedious elements of your day to day job. This isn’t stuff you’ll use SOMEDAY, these are scripts you can use when you get home tonight. Harness the power of Power Shell to easily find Servers short on space. Script out tables and constraints across all of your databases at once. Backup databases and restore them to a different environment. These tricks and many others will allow PowerShell to simplify your job like no other tool.

      <title>DAX from the field: Real World Case Studies</title>
      <description>DAX is still relatively new for many BI practitioners, but it has being used for more than 4 years now, also in large installations that push the xVelocity in memory engine to its limit. In this session, we will share some of the lessons learned from the field, where real customers have problems harder to solve than Adventure Works scenarios. How do you make a database fit in memory, if it does not fit? How do you handle billions of rows with complex calculation? Can you perform reporting in any time zone, with time intelligence, in an efficient way? What tools do you use to benchmark and choose the right hardware? How do you scale up performance on small and large databases? What are the common mistakes in DAX formulas that might cause performance bottlenecks? These are just a few examples of the problems that you will see in this session. You will learn the solutions found and how far you can push the limits of the system.</description>

      <title>FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them</title>
      <description>Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous d</description>

      <title>Modern Performance</title>
      <description>Everyone knows that hardware today is immensely powerful in all aspects- CPU, memory and even IOPS (with proper configuration). It is less appreciated that in recent versions the SQL Server query optimizer can quickly find a good executions plan from a staggering number of possibilities. And yet it is also generally understood that performance is still an important topic today. This apparent paradox stems from the fact that when mistakes happen in software – especially for database query optimization, it can happen in spectacular fashion. Several examples of SQL that can experience catastrophic performance problems are presented, along with the method of diagnosis and corrective action.</description>

      <title>1, 2, 3, … 100. How to manage many SQL Servers the</title>
      <description>Quote: “A good DBA is a lazy DBA”. When you have to manage a few SQL Servers, it’s not that hard to be a lazy DBA and to automate your day to day activities. But when you have to manage over 100 instances, it can become a tough job. Just imagine how you will deploy a new maintenance job on all your instances? Are you going to connect to each server one by one? Not really… Microsoft provides an enhanced set of multi-server management tools. The purpose of this sessions is to point out which SQL Server tools you can use for multi-server management. The session is bulk loaded with demos and it will give you a good idea what features can be helpful in your environment. </description>

      <title>Private Cloud for DBAs</title>
      <description>It's probably rare that you have to install a SQL Server instance manually. You most likely have some unattended install scripts ready and perhaps even a script, using powershell, which configures the newly installed SQL Server according to your (corporate) standards.

But "at home" developers can click a few buttons in Windows Azure and have a SQL Server available within minutes. They are starting to be less impressed with your one-day process. In this session I'll walk you through the steps that you can take to create your own private cloud. Including rolling out sysprepped SQL Server vm's, giving your internal customers self-service capabilities but without losing control over your (corporate) standards. Did you know that you can even get a user interface for your internal customers which looks exacly like the Windows Azure interface?</description>

      <title>Clustered Columnstore Deep Dive</title>
      <description>When it comes to clustered columnstore indexes, you may already understand row groups, delta stores, and compression methods, but come see how clustered columnstore indexes work with locking and blocking and when using different compression methods and techniques. We will also dive deep into Dictionaries creation and different methods for ETL processes.</description>

      <title>SQL anti patterns</title>
      <description>You can learn SQL in three days but it'll take you 10 years to become good at it. In this session we will have a look at some basic design errors and get a notion of the things that absolutely doesn't work. Antipatterns is a way of naming common design errors in order to make them easier to remember - even if you haven't done them yet.

We will become acquainted with antipatterns on a physical level, a logical level and an sql-queries and application level, and spice it up with some seriously foolish errors made by me and my colleagues. The session is relevant for developers and DBAs.</description>

      <title>The nightmare of locking, blocking and isolation levels!</title>
      <description>I am sure you all know that troubleshooting problems related to locking and blocking (hey, sometimes there are deadlocks too) can be a real nightmare! In this session, you will be able to see and understand why and how locking actually works, what problems it causes and how can we use isolation levels and various other techniques to resolve them!</description>

      <title>Query Tuning Superstardom for Beginners</title>
      <description>In this session aimed at the novice query tuner we'll explore what big results may be yielded through the smallest of query tweaks. We will explore impacts of removing unnecessary joins, predicate blunders and problems with returning too much information.  The end result is to improve those bad queries and make you look like a tuning superstar.</description>

      <title>Power View and the Cube</title>
      <description>Did you know that Power View is not any longer limited to getting data from Tabular models ? Now that Power View users can connect to multidimensional BI Semantic Model (Cubes) we will have a look at how to get the best out of this interactive data exploration, visualization and presentation for multidimensional models. 
The session we'll present
- An understanding of the Multidimensional Model Objects in Power View
- How to create a Shared Report Data Source Connection to a Multidimensional Model
- How to create a Power View Report with a Multidimensional Model Data Source
- An visual exploration of a Multidimensional Model by using Power View

      <title>Load Testing Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Ever deployed an Analysis Services cube that worked perfectly well with one user on the development server, only to find that it doesn't meet the required volumes of user concurrency?
 
This session focuses on tools and methodology to load test Analysis Services in highly concurrent environments. Including how to locate resource bottlenecks and the appropriate configuration settings that can help improve performance.
 
Sample source code will be supplied to help you load test analysis services. We will be focused on the MOLAP engine, but techniques are equally applicable to the  tabular model.</description>

      <title>CUBE-functions for fun  profit</title>
      <description>CUBE-functions are a little understood and seldomly used feature of Excel, but they have tremendous power for creating high-impact, custom reports that don’t look like pivottables at all. In this demo-rich presentation we start out by giving an introduction to what they actually do, then dive right into how to make them work for us. In the end we will investigate their use with Excel Services, Powerpivot Services and PowerBI.</description>

      <title>Visualization – tales from the field.  How to build a cool Risk Analysis Dashboard on a shoestring</title>
      <description>Visualization is all the rage – with the focus on Self-Service BI, In-Memory technology and fancy graphics. Tableau, QlikView and Microsoft PowerBi are showing off the eye-candy, and managers like what they see. However, either these solutions cost a lot of money, or your organization is stuck on older versions of software that lacks the functionality needed.
This session will show you how to make a cool dashboard using a database (MS SQL Server 2008), Excel 2010, and in addition how to prepare your solution for SQL2012 and the full PowerBI-suite with PowerPivot
