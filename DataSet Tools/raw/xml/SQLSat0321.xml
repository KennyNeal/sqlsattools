      <title>T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers</title>
      <description>To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users or adequate volume of data  is exists there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live and they become performing badly ending up with standstill cases sometimes , this is due to lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs so I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be analyzed within this session)</description>

      <title>BI on the cloud: Office 365 Power BI</title>
      <description>The need for a self-service business intelligence platform that can help users to turn data into decision-ready insights increases everyday; as does the need  to gradually move on premise investments to a more scalable and manageable cloud platform.
.
As part of its cloud offerings, Microsoft released  Power BI for Office 365. Power BI  is a collection of new features and services that, together, enable users to visualize data, share discoveries, and collaborate in intuitive new ways.
In this session, I will be explaining Power BI in deep, its techniques, features and its pros  cons.
I'll be showing a live demo for a Power BI deployment on Office 365.</description>
