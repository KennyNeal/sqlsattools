      <title>Wait Stats: What are they and why you should care.</title>
      <description>Many Application Support personnel, IT support, and even some DBA's are occasionally bombarded with "My application is slow", "the database keeps timing out", and many other end user complaints when supporting applications in any industry.  Instead of simply blaming it on the developers or simply brushing it off as a "vendor problem", wouldn't it be nice to understand the issues and notify the correct party?  This presentation is intended as a primer for wait stats.  Introducing the concepts, discussing why it's useful, then discussing a few ways that you can take this knowledge and apply it using a number of different approaches.  At the end I've also provided some examples of various LIVE environments I help manage so we can discuss what issues may or may not be prevalent.</description>

      <title>Creating Access 2013 Web Apps based on SQL Azure using SharePoint</title>
      <description>Access 2013 web apps feature a new, full integration with SQL Azure. When you create a web app on SharePoint, Access Services will create SQL Azure database that houses all of your Access objects. This opens up new opportunities for SQL developers to extend and work with the data in Access apps.  In this session you will learn to easily create an Access Web Apps with automatic views, view the online development environment and see a real-world, production web app in action.  We’ll discuss different the use of hybrid applications and integrating office web apps as well as learn about app distribution, deployment and upgrades.  And lastly, see the pros/cons of Access Web Apps in a corporate environment.

      <title>Business Analytics with Microsoft Power BI 101</title>
      <description>The world of data is changing. Mobile, social, and cloud trends are vastly increasing the quantity and types of data available for businesses to leverage in their decision making and strategic planning. Many leading companies are already taking advantage of these newer data trends to improve operational awareness, increase customer reach, and attain better market visibility. Some of the newer features (Power BI) of familiar products such as SQL Server, SharePoint, and Microsoft Office allow businesses to more easily achieve these goals by using technologies they already own.  

This session will provide a high-level overview of Business Intelligence and Big Data, discuss industry trends and use cases, and provide a live demonstration of a Business Analytics scenario using Microsoft Power BI and other tools.

      <title>What’s New in PowerShell Version 5?</title>
      <description>With PowerShell version 4 being announced at TechEd last year and two preview versions of PowerShell version 5 already being released this year, it shows how committed Microsoft is to PowerShell and that it’s not going away any time soon which is why you can’t afford to ignore PowerShell or put off learning it any longer. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will cover the new features that are in the preview version of PowerShell version 5 to include the cmdlets in the OneGet module, the NetworkSwitch module, the PowerShellGet module and much more that you’ll have to come to this session to find out about! This session is based off of a preview version of PowerShell version 5 so everything shown is subject to change.</description>

      <title>Learn PowerShell or Die! for the DBA</title>
      <description>Learn PowerShell or Die! That is, learn PowerShell or your career in IT will die. PowerShell is one of those technologies that as a DBA you’ll either love or hate, but believe it or not DBA’s already have the mindset for scripting since you live and work with T-SQL day in and day out. During this session, scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate the different methods of retrieving information from your SQL Servers to include a way to simply wrap your existing T-SQL code inside of a PowerShell one-liner, working with SQL Server in PowerShell as if it were a file system, and creating reusable tools via functions in PowerShell that use SMO to retrieve just about any information about your SQL Servers that you could imagine.</description>

      <title>Improving your communication and leadership through Toastmasters</title>
      <description>Since 1924, Toastmasters International has been recognized as the leading organization dedicated to communication and 
leadership skill development. Through its worldwide network of clubs, each week Toastmasters helps more than a quarter 
million men and women of every ethnicity, education level and profession build their competence in communication so they 
can gain the confidence to lead others. 
 
By regularly giving speeches, gaining feedback, leading teams and guiding others to achieve their goals in a supportive 
atmosphere, leaders emerge. They learn to tell their stories. They listen and answer. They plan and lead. They give feedback — 
and accept it. They find their path to leadership.

In this session we will demonstrate how a Toastmasters meeting operates, answer your questions about how toastmasters can improve your career and tell you where you can find a club that fits your schedule. Join us and find your path!</description>

      <title>Crash Course in Dependency Injection</title>
      <description>This session will introduce the concept of dependency injection to those that are unfamiliar or have little experience in the area. It will cover some basic use cases and code examples in displaying firsthand the benefits of implementing dependency injection, common "gotchas", etc. It will also go over some of the most popular .NET IoC libraries and help get first time users off their feet. This session will focus on C# specifically, although the dependency injection concept is universal.</description>

      <title>Managing Access Control with PowerShell</title>
      <description>Access control in Windows, while very powerful, can be very complicated. Working with securitydescriptors one object at a time through the GUI is fairly straightforward, but that doesn’t help when you need to verify and/or configure settings for multiple objects at the same time. There are utilities available to handle this in an automated fashion, but most only work with certain types of objects, and they each have their own syntax. Fortunately, PowerShell has the ability to replace most, if not all, of those utility applications. In this session, we'll cover ways to use PowerShell to view and edit access control lists for almost any object in Windows that is secured with a security descriptor, including files, folders, registry keys, services, processes, WMI namespaces, Active Directory objects, and more. We'll cover using both native PowerShell commands, .NET methods, and the free “PowerShellAccessControl” script module.</description>

      <title>Using Agile Project Management in IT Disaster Recovery</title>
      <description>In this session, a novel framework for disaster recovery will be introduced. This framework is suited for a generic large enterprise, but can be tailored to fit specific needs of virtually any company. Using academic and industry research along with lessons learned, we developed an agile-based project management framework for the orchestration function of IT disaster recovery. This framework is intended to serve as a quick response plan that will improve the rate of response and flow of communication in the wake of a natural disaster like the notorious South Louisiana hurricanes.</description>

      <title>AlwaysOn - Finally, A usable 'mirror'!</title>
      <description>In the past, High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) had many limitations. Clustering and Mirroring are great, but the mirror/secondary database is not very usable since it is not online.  Finally, AlwaysOn solves this limitation by merging both multi-node Clustering and mirroring. AlwaysOn also allows the secondary database to remain ONLINE, so we can use it for reporting purposes without resorting to a Snapshot!  Come see this lively session with extensive demos of setting up, configuring and testing AlwaysOn. We'll also test automatic fail-over using a real web app to see how well this feature works.</description>

      <title>What I learned about functional programming in C# while using JavaScript</title>
      <description>Programming in C# is about decomposing code into classes, but is it possible to achieve encapsulation and modularity using only lambdas? Apart from being an interesting excursion into functional features of the C#, this talk will illustrate how modularity can be achieved in languages such as JavaScript that emphasize functions over classes.

A basic understanding of Func and dynamic is necessary. Most of the talk will be coding in C#, with a few snippets of JavaScript.

      <title>Long running task processing with Azure</title>
      <description>Azure offers amazing capacities for computation for a low cost, but it can be a challenge to create a seamless user experience when there are so many moving parts. This talk will go over a methodology of getting potentially gigabytes of data to azure and back to the user seamlessly using ASP.NET MVC, SignalR, and Azure CORS. I also plan to go over some important limitations of various azure services and tools that I've discovered (the hard way) working on my projects with Azure. </description>

      <title>SQL Server Deprecated and Discontinued Features</title>
      <description>Each version of SQL Server provides a list of features which are deprecated – meaning they will be removed in a future version – and a list of features previously deprecated which are discontinued in that version. This session will discuss the deprecated\discontinued features starting with SQL 2008 and will show you how to identify deprecated features so that you can upgrade with ease when those features are finally discontinued.</description>

In this session we will be creating a cross-platform application using PCLs and MVVM to maximize our code sharing. We will also be utilizing HttpClient, async/await, and SQLite. If you've never created a mobile application and would like to know where to start or maybe you have but just haven't used any of these new technologies, come to this session and see how to do it all in C#.</description>

This is not a deep dive into the underlying mechanics of how SQL Server works, but a softer more useful approach to this subject. We will be looking into why changing this could be either good or bad for your environments. This presentation is useful for DBA’s as well as developers trying to get a little more out of their servers.</description>

      <title>SQL Security Best Practices  Shrinking Your Attack Surface</title>
      <description>Every industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data.  In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened.  This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements.  In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data.
In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.

      <title>SQL Server Waits - Dell Software</title>
      <description>Trent will show how SQL Server Waits reveal which of your statements most need tuning.  SQL Waits show the specific workload generated by each statement running against your SQL Server, and this information can be captured and viewed over various time ranges.  Methods for accomplishing this using the natively available utilities will be shown, followed by a look at Dell tools that use this approach.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story</title>
      <description>Foreign Keys have a bad rap – they cause performance issues, they inhibit some inserts, deletes and updates, etc.  This may be true, but let’s further explore why we even have them and how they can benefit and maybe even improve performance.  This session will concentrate on many demos including the attributes associated with foreign keys.  The attendee will walk away from this session with a better understanding of Foreign Key utility and their maintenance. </description>

      <title>Data Warehouse Indexes</title>
      <description>A datawarehouse environment is used differently than a transactional environment, so architecture and indexing strategies should also be different.  In this presentation, we review what the ultimate goal of an index really is, what the point of a data warehouse is, and how they relate to each other.  You will also learn common practices for indexing the different types of warehouse tables, specifically dimension tables, fact tables, and staging tables.  We will review cases when it is useful to have summary level fact tables, in addition to detail level fact tables.  Then, lastly, we will look at the benefits, and gotchas, of using columnstore indexes.</description>
