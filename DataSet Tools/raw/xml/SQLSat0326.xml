      <title>Location Location Location Preparing and Presenting Geographic Data </title>
      <description>This session will begin with the tasks necessary to model a dimensional data structure to maintain and present geographic data.  We will discuss various requirements that can affect a data model such as granularity, surrogate keys, slowly changing dimensions.  Real life examples and solutions will provided to give better context to each step in the process.
After the data structure has been created we will focus on how to best “clean” and validate the geographic data.  We will focus on using SSIS to obtain latitude and longitude and then how this can be converted SQL Server spatial types.
Finally we will cover presenting this data using SSRS and Power Map and how to create dynamic and aesthetically pleasing graphical reports.  This portion of the session concentrates on presenting reports using the geographic data type that answer specific questions such as:
Events that occurred at a specific address, zip code, and even block range and events within a mile radius.

      <title>Tips  Tricks for dynamic SSRS Reports</title>
      <description>In this session we will explore the multitude of ways that you can make your reports adapt to the needs of your users.  This will include defining formats based on the data contents.  We will explore how to refine layouts based on the data to be delivered.  We will demonstrate how to create a parameter driven data source.  We will take a look at how creating templates can give your catalog of reports a more professional look.  All of this together will empower you to have more control over the reports you create.

      <title>Big Data- Part 1 of 3- Let’s Get Started</title>
      <description>In this hour I will show you how to set up a Big Data environment, how to load and transform data, and how to access the data using Hadoop and Microsoft utilities. I will leave you with all of the pieces, parts, instructions, and additional experiments to set up your own environment and get some actual stick time. This is part one in a three part series which will take you from setting up your environment to basic analytics to applying analytics to business decision making.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Business Intelligence and Big Data</title>
      <description>The problem with the old way of organizing and analyzing data in RDBMS is that it is painfully slow, incomplete and costly. We are obligated to be selective and work with data in small chunks. In the best case scenario we partitioned our data and archived it with the hope to eventually use it, but the fact is that when data is being archived, usually, it is never used again. We don’t even bother with collecting all the data due to economics and technical limitations. 
In this presentation I will introduce BI and Big Data, explain advantages and disadvantages of OLTP, OLAP and Big Data.

      <title>Introduction to PowerPivot</title>
      <description>Building an SSAS cube isn't for everyone. PowerPivot is! This session is for anyone who wants to get started in PowerPivot. Join us as we build a PowerPivot model from the ground up and then create some reports, all in just over an hour. Learn how to use data from existing sources, such as SQL Server databases or Analysis Services, as well as how to integrate currently unrelated data from sources such as Excel workbooks.</description>
