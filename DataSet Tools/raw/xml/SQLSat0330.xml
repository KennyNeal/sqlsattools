      <title>Closing the SSIS Package Management Story with BIPS</title>
      <description>Existing SSIS automation solutions are focused on forward-motion activities: creating packages and pushing them to the server.  Little or no thought is given to the management of the packages once they are in production - tools like SQL Data Tools, BIML, and MIST offer nothing to help you understand and manage a live, money-printing ETL workflow based on SSIS packages.

BIPS is an open source project that allows you to manage a live SSIS package tree from PowerShell.  It closes the automation loop, providing the ability to learn and discover the features of an existing package deployment tree as well as manipulate it.  In short, the goal of BIPS brings a devops perspective to managing your SSIS packages.

In this session, you will learn how to leverage BIPS in your own environment.  Specific attention will be given to searching and filtering tasks and data flows on arbitrary criteria and manipulating specific parts of the ETL workflow from the shell. </description>

      <title>Index Tuning for the DBA</title>
      <description>Indexes are like a turbocharger for your queries: they help the engine process queries faster. Without having the right index strategy, you will be stuck managing a SQL Server environment that end users may constantly complain is “too slow.” How do you avoid that situation by knowing which indexes to add or which ones to remove if they are not working—especially if you are not intimate with a particular application’s database? Knowing fundamentals such as baselining performance and proactively monitoring performance are crucial for long-term index maintenance. This session will give you those fundamentals and more to enable you to implement a solid index tuning strategy for your company’s applications.</description>

      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</title>
      <description>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Unit Testing and Integration Testing in SSIS</title>
      <description>Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  

In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This approach uses metadata authored by analysts in Excel to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic. All code will be shared with attendees for free and unrestricted use within their own projects.</description>

      <title>Create and Load a Staging Environment from Scratch in an Hour with Biml</title>
      <description>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) automates your BI patterns and eliminates the manual repetition that consumes most of your SSIS development time. During this hour long presentation, Scott Currie from Varigence will use the free BIDSHelper add-in for BIDS and SSDT to introduce Biml and use to automatically generate large quantities of custom SSIS packages. The session will be largely demonstration driven, and reusable sample code will be distributed for you to use in your own projects. Using a live-typing approach, Scott will start from scratch and by the end of the session create a full-blown staging environment. This will include the creation of *hundreds* of target table creation scripts, data load packages, data scrubbing rules, logging, and more. The best part is that you can freely reuse the code in your own environment just by changing the connection strings - or make small changes to implement your own data load patterns.</description>

      <title>Best Practices to Deliver BI Solutions</title>
      <description>If your company is planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution, you need to be aware that BI projects have high failure rates. Gartner says between 70% to 80% of corporate business intelligence projects fail. And with “big data” adding more complexity you can expect even more failures. However, the major causes of these failures are well known and can be avoided by implementing a set of best practices.

I have worked on dozens of end-to-end BI projects and have seen my share of successes and failures. I will talk about the reasons BI projects fail and share best practices and lessons learned so your BI project will fall into the “successful” category.</description>

      <title>BI DBA Performance Tuning</title>
      <description>Data Warehouses and OLTP systems are different!  But there are some core concepts that we need to understand for managing and maintaining both.  Do you want to know how you can load data faster, just by setting up your database correctly?  Are your queries running slow?  Want to understand how you can reduce locking and blocking in reporting queries?  Do you have a system with views, that reference views, which reference more views?  Let's discuss some core concepts and techniques that will get you out of the slow lane and on your way to a faster Data Warehouse!</description>

      <description>Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Tracking (CT) have been standard features in SQL Server for a few years now but there's not really that much useful information out in the blogosphere about how they work under the hood. Kevin Hazzard will dig deep into the implementations of CDC and CT in SQL Server, showing you all of the parameters you can use to make these great features serve your organization well. This will be a highly-interactive, highly-entertaining session with lots of questions answered and mysteries revealed.</description>

      <title>Applied Enterprise Semantic Mining</title>
      <description>Text mining is projected to dominate data mining, and the reasons are evident:  we have more text available than numeric data.  Microsoft introduced a new technology to SQL Server 2014 called Semantic Search. This session's detailed description and demos give you important information for the enterprise implementation of Tag Index and Document Similarity Index, and will also provide a comparison between what semantic search is and what Delve does. The demos include a web-based Silverlight application, and content documents from Wikipedia. We'll also look at strategy tips for how to best leverage the new semantic technology with existing Microsoft data mining.</description>

      <description>Are your databases being backed up? Are you sure? Are you sure they're being backed up correctly? Maybe you're an "accidental DBA" or a developer who's not quite sure of the answers to those questions. In this session, you'll learn what the different types of basic backups are, how to execute them, and (perhaps most importantly) how to restore from them if and when necessary.</description>

      <title>Documenting SSIS packages using XQuery</title>
      <description>You have been given responsibility over an SSIS package.  One of the first things that you want to discover is where the data is coming from and what operations happen between the source and the target.  In this session you will learn some XQuery that you can use to trace the flow of data from different sources to SQL Server.  You will identify the Derived Column operations that alter the data from the source. You will see how to load XML from a file to query it.</description>

      <description>Hive is the SQL like interface for Hadoop, aka Big Data. Hive was developed for two audiences, the newbie and, the hive developer. For the newbie almost any query will work in hive, eventually. The first part of the session will cover the differences between SQL and HQL so that anyone that has written a SQL query can start working with Hive. The second part of the session will cover the differences, at a high level, in how a traditional query engine works and how the Hive query engine works. We will discuss how the Hive query engine makes use of the distributed nature of Hadoop and what are considered best practices when writing Hive queries.</description>

      <title>Querying in the 21’st century – A window into Windowing functions</title>
      <description>SQL Server introduced Windowing functions in version 2005. Intended to offer the ability to work with windows of data (as a set) in SQL, they pack the power, ease of use and flexibility to query data that traditional SQL lacked (possible but complicated). 2012 rounded the capabilities and added quite a bit. In this session, we will take a look at the available features and how to apply them in practice with tons of practical examples.</description>

      <description>This is a session for DBAs and Developers working with SSAS who are not sure what happens under the hood when it is queried, or how to tell if it's performing at its best. This is not a session on query optimization. Rather, this session will help you better understand if you should focus on query optimization or if some basic configuration changes might provide that needed performance boost. We'll discuss the basic architecture of SSAS and cover some of the most pertinent metrics to give you a quick and easy view into your SSAS server's performance. </description>

      <description>With the introduction of Power BI, Microsoft has moved one step closer to its vision of self-service BI for all.  But with this new offering comes a bevy of "Power" apps that are bound to confuse just about anyone.  In this session, we will power through Power BI for Office 365 bringing meaning to the mess of names like Power Query, Power Map, Power Pivot and Power View and how these experiences are delivered through Microsoft Excel and Office 365.  Expect to leave with the power of insight into an exciting new offering that captures the essence of self-service BI.</description>
