      <title>Get to Know HDInsight and Start Mining Big Data</title>
      <description>The adoption of Hadoop as a platform for mining big data has opened up a new world of analytic possibilites. Using HDInsight, the cloud-based service from Microsoft, you now have the ability to fire up Hadoop on demand to get the maximum value from large and unstructured data. 

In this introductory session, you will learn the fundamentals of HDInsight and Hadoop, you'll see how to provision your own cluster in minutes, and you'll know how to put the cluster to work by the end of the session. Practical examples that show clustering techniques and text analysis of unstructured and semi-structured data will be shown allowing attendees to implement their own cluster with minimal administration overhead.</description>

      <title>Women in Tech Panel</title>
      <description>The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%. Attend this WIT session to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/)</description>

      <title>Getting started with Dimensional Modeling</title>
      <description>Technology has revolutionized the way organizations run today. Rather than a few file cabinets, organizations use many different software packages and applications that are mission critical to running their business. These systems gather a large amount of valuable data that must be used in decision making to maintain a competitive advantage. However, we've all heard and likely been around when mission critical systems have been rendered useless due to long running reports. To solve this and a host of other source system reporting issues we have proven Data Warehousing techniques to store the data in a report friendly way. Dimensional modeling is one of the most widely used set of techniques that will provide source system relief for reporting. In this session, we will take a look at what Dimensional Modeling is along with some key terms and techniques.</description>

      <description>Have you become the de facto DBA? Have you been tasked with the responsibility of backing up your databases? Do you feel that your database maintenance plan is adequate, but may be lacking in what it can do?  If these scenarios sound familiar, you’ll want to join this session, where Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) Keith Tate will walk you through the basics of backup and restore options. 
The session will begin with the reasons why databases must be backed up (hint: to restore them). Then, discuss the different recovery models and how they affect your backup strategy. Next, explore ways to automate backup and restore strategies, and review ways to improve the speed of your backups and restores. Finally, put it all together and you’ll be on your way to a disaster proof backup and restore strategy.

      <title>Scripting in SSIS</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integration Services is full of useful and versatile tasks, components, and containers that allow the ETL developer to easily handle most data movement and transformation issues. However, it's not uncommon to run into ETL need that require more flexibility than what is offered in the native tools of SSIS. Fortunately, Integration Services comes with a couple of tools to overcome most any ETL challenge: the Script Task and the Script Component.

In this session, we will explore both the Script Task and Script Component tools within SSIS. We will discuss the reasons why one might need to include scripting as part of an ETL strategy, as well as examining some use cases where scripting is a good fit. We will follow up with several demonstrations of how to solve specific ETL challenges using the Script Task and Script Component in SSIS.</description>

      <description>You have geospatial data and you know that plotting it on a map will deliver insights. Or maybe you keep hearing “geospatial” as a current BI buzzword and you want to be informed about your options when you get to it. The Microsoft BI stack provides several options for visualizing location data. But how do you know which tool will best serve your purpose, or what factors are important in making this decision? We’ll identify factors to consider when choosing a tool to visualize your data in maps such as system requirements, availability and type of location data, required level of technical understanding, and more. You’ll leave the session confident in your ability to choose the best tool within Excel and SQL Server.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you execute a query? In this unique demonstration, Todd will use a video game engine (Unreal Engine 4) and will dramatically show The Life Cycle of a Query in 3D. We will follow a query from beginning to end and "runthrough" the various SQL Server components all queries must use including the Protocol Layer, Relational Engine, Storage Engine, Buffer Pool and then back out to the client. A volunteer at the end will then don an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset for 3D Gaming and then race through the sections in under a minute to win a prize. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the major components and with a conceptual framework to explore the components more in-depth.</description>

      <description>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</description>

      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

In this half day session, we will build the foundation for using Powershell as a database administrator.  Three areas will be covered:
 - Powershell fundamentals - How the language works and how to write it
 - Powershell/SQL Server integration - Functionality written specifically for SQL Server
 - Application of Powershell - Use cases and code examples that leverage Powershell for database management

This session is intended for database administrators of all levels who have minimal experience with Powershell.  Attendees who participate in this session will leave with a solid foundation of Powershell and how to apply it in their own environments.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Execution Plans  Query Tuning</title>
      <description>There are times when you are able to be proactive and tune existing queries. Sometimes, you will receive a phone call from your manager telling you that a certain web page or report is timing out and your users are furious. You need to quickly diagnose what the problem is. Where do you turn to first? When a query is under-performing, hogging resources or timing out, one of the first things you want to examine is the query execution plan. The Query Optimizer, Execution Plans  Query Tuning are the three key topics covered. At the end of the session you will walk away with the confidence to diagnose and tune queries.</description>

This session will teach you how to get great performance, avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world. </description>

      <title>The Lost Science of Set Theory</title>
      <description>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.</description>

In this session we're going to step through the process of evaluating the statistics present (or not present) and present a methodology for analyzing the presence of skew, candidate filtered statistics, and their efficacy in an environment. Additionally, we'll look at the impacts of the new Cardinality Estimator in SQL Server 2014 on plan generation This would, ultimately, be an excellent addition to any periodic SQL Server health check.</description>

      <title>VLDBs: Lessons Learned</title>
      <description>VLDBs (Very Large Databases) play in a different league: common maintenance operations can take much longer to run, and some settings and features that work well on smaller databases become much less effective. These downsides generally have a negative impact on users, however through some creativity and changes in our game plan we can have highly performant VLDBs. This session will cover a wide variety of tips and tricks assembled from years of working with databases up to 40TB in size.</description>

      <title>SSIS Logging Reconsidered</title>
      <description>The advent of SQL Server 2012, SQL Server Data Tools and Integration Services Catalogs have significantly improved out of the box logging.  Unfortunately, logging best practices have not evolved with the new logging tools.  This talk will outline the logging available “out of the box” with SSIS and discuss the implications for “traditional” ETL logging.  Logging best practices will vary by business, industry and regulatory environments.  We will review examples from the most basic operational logging to the most sophisticated logging required for auditing and regulatory compliance. </description>

      <title>Reporting Services In An AlwaysOn World</title>
      <description>While we don’t always see SQL Server Reporting Services as a mission-critical function, reporting has become more and more important with the BI explosion.  Reports are driving crucial business decisions and providing invaluable information to users on a daily basis.  With the introduction of AlwaysOn in SQL Server 2012, it seemed like Reporting Services was forgotten when it comes to HA support.  In this talk, we’ll look at possible HA solutions for the ReportServer databases along with application servers.  We’ll also discuss some of the challenges that arise from it and how to navigate them as best possible.</description>
