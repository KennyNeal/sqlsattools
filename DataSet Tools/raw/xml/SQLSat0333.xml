      <title>SQL Server 2014 Cardinality Estimator changes  </title>
      <description>This session covers the changes made to Cardinality Estimations and Calculations in SQL Server 2014.
SQL Server 2014 introduces the first major redesign of the SQL Server Query Optimizer cardinality estimation process since version 7.0. The goal for the redesign was to improve accuracy, consistency and supportability of key areas within the cardinality estimation process, ultimately affecting average query execution plan quality and associated workload performance. 
Topics Covered in this session
How to enable and disable the new cardinality estimator behavior?
What changed in new cardinality estimations?
How to troubleshoot plan-quality regressions if and when they occur?
Note : Presentation based on recent white paper released from Microsoft.</description>

      <title>Designing a Better Database</title>
      <description>Most everyone knows how to build a table, an index, or a relationship, but the real challenge in database design is the process the data professional uses to interpret the business requirements into database designs which are both flexible and extensible.

In this session, I will NOT tell you the syntax of any database object.

In this session, we will review some of the common challenges we face and some philosophies which will help us to design and deliver better database designs.

      <title>Data-ing Advice: Profiles are Important</title>
      <description>Data warehousing professionals often consider data profiling to be drudgery and/or an unnecessary part of the larger warehouse design process.  However, information unearthed during this process can prove instrumental in avoiding pitfalls later on.  This session will explore the reasons for profiling and scenarios in which it proves particularly useful.  We will also discuss profiling methods, including the SSIS profiling task and supplemental profiling techniques that provide both developers and business users insight into the quality and consistency of source data.</description>

      <title>The Elephant in the Room; A DBA's Guide to Hadoop  Big Data</title>
      <description>The term "Big Data" has risen to popularity in the last few years, and encompasses data platforms outside of the traditional RDBMS (like SQL Server).  The purpose of this session is to introduce SQL Server DBA's to Hadoop, and to promote understanding of how schema-less data can be collected and accessed in coordination with the traditional SQL models.  We'll cover the basic vocabulary of the Hadoop platform, Microsoft's integration efforts, and demonstrate how to get started with "big data".</description>

      <description>NULL - an unknown value. At least, that's what it's SUPPOSED to be. The problem is, NULL is often treated differently based on what you're doing - even equality is suspect. Join JK as he works on demystifying NULLs in the database, looking at how they interact with various queries and how to work around and with the idiosyncrasies of this sometimes misunderstood concept.</description>

      <title>Bridging The Gap</title>
      <description>For many who come to T-SQL from other languages, dealing with result sets and thinking in set based solutions can be frustrating.  Our minds are conditioned to think in processing rows of data, not entire sets. As a consequence many give up and misuse cursors or come up with other ways to create RBAR (Row By Agonizing Row) solutions. Some others try to deal with sets but get caught in the tangle of nested queries. In this session I will deal with Table Expressions with particular emphasis on CTEs or Common Table Expressions.  Let me show you how using these simple tools can help simplify your code, bridging the gap between RBAR and set based solutions.</description>

      <title>WIT Panel</title>
      <description>The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.   Attend this WIT session to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/) </description>

      <title>Understanding SQL Server XML Features </title>
      <description>The XML Functionality embedded into SQL Server 2005 and 2008 is one of its most powerful yet least understood features.  This seems to be primarily because DBA's shy away from it and developers prefer to work with XML in their code.  In this session we will explore the XML features of SQL Server and how we can bridge these two worlds. Topics covered will include retrieving relational data as XML, storing XML in the database using the XML Datatype, XML indexes, and the XQuery functions included in SQL Server.  We will also look at using XML as stored procedure parameters as a way to pass large amounts of complex data between client and server. </description>
