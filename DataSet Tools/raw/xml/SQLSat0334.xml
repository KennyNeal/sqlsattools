      <title>SSIS-restart, scale up/out, load balance.</title>
      <description>This presentation is a journey through some of the common challenges facing DBAs and SSIS developers: scaling up and/or out to increase throughput, load balancing, recoverability and restartability, basic process auditing, multiple job dependency checking.  Next we will review the essential elements to building a framework based on the work pile design pattern that will help resolve many of the issues these challenges may bring. The end goal is a framework that will manage a set of jobs that can recover from common errors, be spread across multiple servers, check load consistency and make sure that nothing runs unless the appropriate upstream data is available. </description>

      <title>Building an Effective Data Warehouse Architecture</title>
      <description>You’re a DBA, and your boss asks you to determine if a data warehouse would help the company. So many questions pop into your head: Why use a data warehouse? What’s the best methodology to use when creating a data warehouse? Should I use a normalized or dimensional approach? What’s the difference between the Kimball and Inmon methodologies? Does the new Tabular Model change things? What’s the difference between a data warehouse and a data mart? Is there any hardware that is optimized for a data warehouse? Join this session for the answers to all these questions. You’ll leave with information that will amaze your boss and lead to a big raise… – or at least lead you down the correct path to adding business value to your organization!</description>

      <title>The Modern Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>Current models of data warehousing are being challenged by data that is coming at us bigger, faster, and more variable that it ever has before. In traditional models we would throw out much of the data or aggregate to a course grain so that we could gain query performance but may loose some of the nuance needed for deep analytics. How is Microsoft bridging the GAP between the need for speed in both data ingestion and query performance? How is Microsoft integrating the worlds of relational and non-relational data? This session will discuss aspects of Microsoft's data warehouse vision ranging from traditional SMP, our MPP appliance, what we are doing in the cloud and how it all works together. </description>

      <description>How often have our SQL Servers been bogged down with a myriad of users issuing lengthy and poorly constructed or poorly performing queries against our tables and views.More often than not,nearly bringing our systems to their knees.Nowhere is this truer than within the financial world where heavy number crunching is par for the course.This beginners to intermediate level hands-on presentation is aimed at the SQL Server developer and business analyst alike and will show the attendee how we had managed to eliminate 90 % of our poorly performing queries by creating a data access layer which provides our end users with a suite of well developed and tuned SQL Server FUNCTIONS and UDT's with which to render their data.</description>

      <title>See the Future with SQL Running Totals - Never Run Out of Anything Again</title>
      <description>Have you ever run out of something?  Do you need to order things now that you know will be needed by a certain date?  
This seemingly simple problem can get complicated, whether you are making a shopping list for a party, or doing supply chain planning for a factory.
Special functions in T-SQL and SSRS can help you build a visual model of future supply and demand, so you will know if all your bases are covered.
We will demonstrate algorithms for tracking running totals and check that they scale well to handle big data sets, and build a flexible report to answer "what if" scenarios.  Come learn how to use SQL Server tools to build a looking glass to the future!</description>

      <title>A dive into Data Quality Services</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2014: Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.</description>

      <title>Best Practices to Deliver BI Solutions</title>
      <description>If your company is planning to build a data warehouse or BI solution, you need to be aware that BI projects have high failure rates. Gartner says between 70% to 80% of corporate business intelligence projects fail. And with “big data” adding more complexity you can expect even more failures. However, the major causes of these failures are well known and can be avoided by implementing a set of best practices.

I have worked on dozens of end-to-end BI projects and have seen my share of successes and failures. I will talk about the reasons BI projects fail and share best practices and lessons learned so your BI project will fall into the “successful” category.</description>

      <title>Shade Tree Mechanic's Guide to SSAS</title>
      <description>This is a session for DBAs and Developers working with SSAS who are not sure what happens under the hood when it is queried, or how to tell if it's performing at its best. This is not a session on query optimization. Rather, this session will help you better understand if you should focus on query optimization or if some basic configuration changes might provide that needed performance boost. We'll discuss the basic architecture of SSAS and cover some of the most pertinent metrics to give you a quick and easy view into your SSAS server's performance. </description>

      <title>Setting up your BI Infrastructure</title>
      <description>We know BI in bits and pieces. But imagine if you had to setup the BI infrastructure from scratch. 
What do we need to consider, which players do we consider, what are the components, the HA/DR scenario for the same, what technology to use? These are the questions we will attempt to answer along the way.
What are the best practices involved in creating a BI infrastructure. We can discuss whether to outsource this project or rise above our DBA job and do it ourselves.</description>

      <title>Azure Machine Learning Studio</title>
      <description>Machine Learning is working its way into all of our businesses. One of the biggest challenges faced by the data science or analytic teams that perform work in predictive analytics is how to operationalize the models that they create. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is a fully hosted machine learning platform that streamlines the process of creating, training and testing predictive models and allows you to put them into production hosted in the cloud. 

In this session we will introduce the Azure ML platform, discuss some of the current uses, and understand how to overcome some of the common challenges with hosting models in the cloud. </description>

      <title>Exploiting Excel Cube Functions in your Reports and Dashboards</title>
      <description>A best kept secret, cube functions retrieve data from Analysis Services cubes and Power Pivot data models. Flexibility of formatting and layout (any cell, anywhere) make cube functions ideal for building Excel dashboards and reports requiring very specific placement.
This session introduces the seven cube functions, while focusing on those most useful. Live demos will highlight report building techniques, practical considerations, leveraging MDX, legacy report migration, text data retrieval from Power Pivot and more.</description>

      <title>Power to the people!!</title>
      <description>Power Pivot and Power View provide new and innovative ways for end users to view their data and to convert this data to valuable information. Enabling and convincing end users to take ownership of their data (as Data Stewards) is half the challenge, and in practice is not all that problematic.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking at practical ways and means of creating reports, utilizing Power Pivot and Power View. We shall take advantage of the BISM and have our data stored within a SQL Server tabular database. All examples come from actual implementations and we shall be looking at the constructive feedback provided by end users.

      <title>Using Power BI to Deliver Self-Service BI</title>
      <description>Over the past few years Microsoft has been investing heavily in self-service BI, and today it is possible to deliver Business Intelligence using nothing but Excel 2013.
Join us as we demonstrate how using the latest Microsoft BI toolset you can easily discover, analyze, and visualize any data. 
We will begin the session by using Power Query and the M language to import and shape our dataset. Then we will use Power Pivot and some basic DAX to build out a powerful in-memory data model. Lastly we will demonstrate how to present our data using Power View, and share our newly gained insights using Power BI for Office 365 and Power BI QA.</description>

      <title>Data-ing Advice: Profiles are Important</title>
      <description>Data warehousing professionals often consider data profiling to be drudgery and/or an unnecessary part of the larger warehouse design process.  However, information unearthed during this process can prove instrumental in avoiding pitfalls later on.  This session will explore the reasons for profiling and scenarios in which it proves particularly useful.  We will also discuss profiling methods, including the SSIS profiling task and supplemental profiling techniques that provide both developers and business users insight into the quality and consistency of source data.</description>
