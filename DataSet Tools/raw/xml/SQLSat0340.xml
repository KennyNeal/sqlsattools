      <title>Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)</title>
      <description>In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.</description>

      <title>Access-to-SQL Server Nuts and Bolts</title>
      <description>At last year’s SQL Saturday (#249) we made the case for “Pumping up your Access application with a SQL Server back-end”.  This year we’re going to going to look at the code to make that happen.  We’ll pull the covers off a real-world application and see how we read and write SQL Server data using VBA.  We’ll also examine SQL code on the back end (views, stored procedures, triggers) and how to apportion the workload so that we’re taking advantage of the respective strengths of both Access and SQL Server in manipulating data and managing resources.  We might also get a peek at some performance metrics to see the impact of different indexing schemes and querying approaches.  Even though the topic is about interfacing Access to SQL Server, there will be a lot of emphasis on server-side coding and will be a good intro or refresher for people who just want to learn how to write T-SQL scripts.</description>

      <description>This session will begin with the tasks necessary to model a dimensional data structure to maintain and present geographic data.  We will discuss various requirements that can affect a data model such as granularity, surrogate keys, slowly changing dimensions.  Real life examples and solutions will provided to give better context to each step in the process.
After the data structure has been created we will focus on how to best “clean” and validate the geographic data.  We will focus on using SSIS to obtain latitude and longitude and then how this can be converted SQL Server spatial types.
Finally we will cover presenting this data using SSRS and Power Map and how to create dynamic and aesthetically pleasing graphical reports.  This portion of the session concentrates on presenting reports using the geographic data type that answer specific questions such as:
Events that occurred at a specific address, zip code, and even block range and events within a mile radius.

      <title>Statistics and Query Optimization</title>
      <description>There are any number of tricks and traps around getting the query optimizer to provide you with an optimal execution plan that gets you your data quickly and efficiently. But, at the end of the day, the principal driving factor of the optimizer, and therefore of your queries, are the statistics that define your data. This session teaches you how those statistics are put together and maintained by SQL Server. Different types of maintenance results in different levels of accuracy within statistics so we detail what the structures and information looks like after this maintenance. Your understanding of how the optimizer works with statistics will better enable you to understand why you’re getting the performance and types of execution plans that you are getting. Understanding enables you to write better t-sql statements and deal with performance problems such as bad parameter sniffing.</description>

      <title>Keeping your SQL Objects Safe In Development</title>
      <description>It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code. </description>

      <title>Standardize SQL Server Implementations (Dev to Prod)</title>
      <description>You'll learn about a best practice framework that alleviates many of the pain points for deploying, managing, and supporting multiple SQL Server deployments from development to production.  
There are many variables to consider when supporting SQL Servers in the real world, including:  
• Cloud systems (Microsoft Azure/Amazon AWS), virtualization (VMware/HyperV), physical servers
• Different versions of SQL Servers, and different editions (Standard/Enterprise)
• Service packs and specific Hotfixes
• Configuration differences based on OS/Memory/Disk configuration

      <title>Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight</title>
      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>Data Quality:  Boosting Software Performance and Business Profit</title>
      <description>If "Data is the Lifeblood of Modern Business," then most businesses are walking corpses with sludge in their veins, because 10% to 25% of all data records in the average enterprise are wrong.  Until the dramatic problems of Data Quality Management are addressed, SQL can never fulfill its original promise to eliminate application "silos", enable systems to communicate and provide useful, actionable information to the modern business.  I believe that we are on the cusp of a revolution in Data Quality that is even greater in scope and impact than the revolution in manufacturing quality that began over 40 years ago.  Businesses that make the transition will survive and thrive.  Those that don't will finally stop shambling about and lay down to die.What is this revolution in Data Quality?  How can you be a part of it (and avoid the headman's ax)?!?  This presentation will change the way you think about your jobs as Database Administrators and Application Developers.</description>

      <title>Data Masking Algorithms Strengths</title>
      <description>"All animals are created equal but some of the more equal than the other." - and so are algorithms. Data masking is used to secure privacy of data and brings data lifecycle processes into the compliance with HIPAA, FEPRA, GLBA , state and European regulations. Data masking uses a variety of algorithms. Each algorithm has a different strength and your understanding how secure the algorithms are  protects your organization from not only from non-compliance risks, but also from reputational and monetary damages - and it saves your job. </description>

      <description>This session is about tools in T-SQL that allow you to generate a sequence of values, often used as surrogate keys, but sometimes for other purposes. The session covers the identity column property and the limitations it imposes. It covers the sequence object which was added in SQL Server 2012. It compares and contrasts the sequence object with the identity property, including a performance comparison. If time permits, the session will also discuss generating sequences of integers with the ROW_NUMBER function, and describe some creative ways to use it.</description>

      <title>Database Release Management: Tips to help organize it</title>
      <description>The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. 

We will discuss various terms, define processes, share ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

You might want to just stick your head in the sand and ignore it, but as database professionals it is always good to know about what other technologies might be out there to compliment your existing solutions.  We will not be going deep into any one solution, but by the end of this session, the goal will be that you understand the following:

1. The different types of NoSQL databases
2. Some use cases where they might be applicable
3. Some of the major solutions out there for each one</description>

It's not necessarily because the craftsmen have better dexterity or strength than most people, it's because they understand an effective way to think about their craft.

Join us for a conversation about SQL, why it's different from traditional procedural languages, and how to effectively use this truly elegant programming language. Rather than focus on the kinds of information easily located on the Web, we'll concentrate on how to use SQL for the tasks that it's really good at.  </description>

      <title>Implementing Auditing in SQL Server 2012 </title>
      <description>SQL Audit provides the ability to track and log activities and changes at the instance or database level built upon Extended Events SQL Audit provides both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities. The granularity of events that can be monitored and tracked with SQL Audit can only be matched by means of using a SQL Profiler trace, but provides reduced overhead. This presentation will provide insight into the internals of SQL Audit, along with how to plan, create, and monitor instance and database level audits. </description>

      <title>First Normal Form</title>
      <description>The Relational Data Model is the foundation of everything we do in SQL Server, and yet I often see basic violations of it.  These violations hurt query performance, compromise data integrity and reduce the value of our business's data.  In this presentation, I cover the most basic aspect of the Relational Data Model:  First Normal Form.  I will describe what it is, common violations of it and the programming problems these violations create.</description>

      <title>Treating Tables Like Legos, Partitioning Basics</title>
      <description>Partitioning allows us to isolate parts of our table as small chunks called partitions.  In turn, these partitions allow us to do some really cool tricks for manageability and performance.  In this session we'll look at the concepts surrounding partitioning and how we can apply them.  We'll reinforce what we cover with some cool demo's showing some really neat tricks.</description>

      <title>Advanced SSIS Techniques</title>
      <description>SSIS is a tool that simplifies ETL and other workflow development., automates DB maintenance and can be used to automate lifecycle. 
It has a lot of faculties that allow to extend its functionality, from built-in expressions mechanisms to scripts to custom components  building. However, it takes patience to explore these capabilities - and we want to help developers cut time necessary to learn the intricacies of the SSIS development.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Storage internals: Looking under the hood.</title>
      <description>Ever wonder what goes on under the hood of your SQL Servers? SQL Server is a complicated system. Understanding how your data is actually stored on disk can have a profound effect on the choices you make while designing and architecting a solution. In this session I'll show you how data is physically stored and how choices you make effect performance. We'll look at the structure of rows and data pages, index allocation maps, and the physical differences between heaps and clustered indexes.</description>

      <title>(Violing Memory) Flash storage 101 and what it can do for your databases</title>
      <description>NAND flash storage is becoming the storage of choice on which to run performance-demanding workloads. Moving to flash storage without architectural changes, however, may not result in reaching the desired goal. This session will give an overview of how our technology works, what to look for in the world of flash, and how to modernize your database architecture with this new technology.</description>
