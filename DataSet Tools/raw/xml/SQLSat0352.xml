      <title>Automate your Data Profiling insights using Power BI</title>
      <description>Data profiling is a critical input task to any database initiative that incorporates source data from external systems. With the right data profiling, it’s possible to gain a huge amount of insight into the data quality in your systems, and as a result, be able to make radically more accurate estimates of the cost to go from the "as is" to the "to be". The Data Profiling task in SSIS can be very powerful, but it is tricky to use and time consuming to review the findings, until now. 
In this session I will demonstrate how you can automate data profiling of any SQL Server Database using Integration Services, and use the output of the data profiling task to populate a Power Pivot data model. 
This data model can then be used to analyse table structures, data quality and identify problems with your data. By using the different profiles you can determine how to clean up your incoming data prior to loading it into your database.

      <description>In this session you will see how to unleash Microsoft Excel and gain an understanding of what all the hype is about in the world of Power BI. We will show you the true meaning of the word ‘Power’ in Power BI. You will witness world-shattering evolutionary changes in Excel data access with Power Query and how this product can be used to transform this widely known and well used tool into a sophisticated next generation ETL platform that rivals even the likes of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) itself! Not only will we show you how to access data from both internal and external sources, but you will see how simple and easy it is to transform and shape data in a variety of sophisticated ways. From world population statistics, economic and health trend indicators, scraping web pages and spreadsheets to MotoGP championship racing and your favourite movies – the world of data is changing, attend this session to see how you can enable yourself to catch the wave and ‘mash it up’ today!</description>

      <title>Interactive  Actionable Data Visualisation With Power View</title>
      <description>Historically, users have been constrained to consume data in fixed platforms, with one specific dimension for digital viewings and a couple of printed layouts. Nowadays, with the ubiquitous mobile devices available, Management expects to know key business indicators and day-to-day operation performance on the go. Using well-designed data models and visualization techniques, Power View can leverage timely and quick dashboards for analysis on the go.   
  
This session will discuss how to design the appropriate data model to enable self-service data exploration and insightful analysis in Power View, and how to create pixel perfect visualization for mobile devices. You will also learn how the techniques differ from traditional platforms. Using live demo, we will walk through ways to channel users focus on actionable analytics.  </description>

      <title>Thinking Out of the Box: Manage SQL Server Using Built-in Tools</title>
      <description>It’s often the case that your budget doesn’t stretch far enough for all the great third party tools that help manage your SQL Servers. So, how can the in-built components of SQL Server help you with your daily tasks?

Policy Management, Data Collector and Extended Events, all included in both Enterprise and Standard Editions, provide a framework to keep your configurations consistent and give you some insights into the performance of your SQL Server instances. In this session, we will see how to make use of these components to formalize your configuration and track some performance attributes.

After this session you’ll be able to build out an effective management and monitoring toolkit using only “out-of-the-box” features.</description>

      <title>“Show Me Potential Customers “ : Data Mining Approach</title>
      <description>In the most marketing departments, the tactical question is about who are going to buy our products.  It is more cost effective to identify and spend money on highly potential customers (than those who are not likely to purchase).  This also affects the advertisement strategy. Potential customers and their traits can be identified by analysing previous purchasing information. Management experts can predict who is going to be their new customers by analysing their current customer purchase information. There are many data mining algorithms which can help with this task.  Microsoft Business Intelligence employs data mining algorithms that are deployed in an easy to use environment.
This demonstration based session will show how to use previous customer purchase information to predict potential customers. We will discuss how to set data sets and use different data mining algorithms to get predictive results and then demonstrate how to find the best predictions.</description>

      <title>Kick-ass Ad-hoc Cube Browser build in SSRS 2014</title>
      <description>Hot from USA PASS Analytics Conference session.

You will learn how to use generic reporting techniques in SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to create a virtually unlimited set of dynamic reports for your users by simply changing report parameters. Just change dashboard report contents and share components for looking up values.

The techniques we will discuss are based on concepts in the books “Advanced Reporting Services 2012” and “Reporting Services Recipes.” By attending this session, you will learn enough to use the Angry Koala Cube Browser and Angry Koala Cube Surfer and modify to your own organization’s needs. Join this practical session, which will give you lots of ideas for your own users.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Unit Testing and Integration Testing in SSIS </title>
      <description>Testing is critical to managing a high-quality data lifecycle. Unfortunately, SSIS has no built-in support for test authoring and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered. In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This approach uses metadata authored by analysts in Excel to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic. All code will be shared with attendees for free and unrestricted use within their own projects.</description>

      <title>Everything you would like to know about Power BI - QA</title>
      <description>One of the Power BI features users have been interested in is QA, which takes data exploration to a whole new level. With QA, users type ad-hoc questions and the system provides them with answers in the form of interactive charts and graphs.  The search like experience is instantaneous and uses a natural language query, interpreting the semantics of question the user is typing. This session will be covered with a lot of samples of deployment, configuration, optimization etc.</description>
