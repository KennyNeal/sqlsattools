      <title>ORM Tuning From A Database Perspective</title>
      <description>Most ORM's tend to be very chatty and generate complex queries. Which is not a bad thing most of the time, but sometimes it get's out of hand and the queries will either be too complex or, and this I see the most, there will be way to many queries to answer relatively simple questions. Seeing thousands of queries for a simple webpage is not uncommon.

In this session we will look at optimising database access in ORM's. Using Nhibernate, LINQ  Entity Framework in the demos, we will examine how your ORM talks to the database and why.

We will look at this problem from 2 sides. As a developer who would like to tweak and tune as little as possible and let the ORM do it's magic, and as a DBA who would like all queries to ask only for the data that you need to have at that time. Using a lot of demo's we will be looking at typical ORM features like Lazy Loading, Mapping, Caching, Inverse Relationships, etc. 

We will conclude with some best practices and lessons learned.</description>

      <title>Deadlocks 2.0. Everything that developer needs to know</title>
      <description>It's no secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. This is an exceptional situation, when two concurrent queries request same resources, but in a different order. Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunatelly in real life deadlocks can be more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: " You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". So we should deal with them. The algorythm is following: catch, analyze, fix. The most challenging and interesting here is the analysis part. Once you understand why it was occured, you can fix it. In this session we will focus on the analysis of complex,</description>

      <title>A deep dive into SQL Server Plan Cache Management  </title>
      <description>As an experienced DBA you have probably asked yourself questions like how the memory is consumed, is my system well-tuned, and is my memory configuration well defined. In order to understanding such processes as local and global Memory pressure, caches concurrency, adding and removing plans from cache we will go through the internal organization of the plan cache, the metadata available, how SQL Server finds a plan in cache, plan cache sizing, and the plan eviction policy. We will point out the important cache consumers that affect your workload and how to get metadata about them, what are the thresholds in Cache Size Management. At the end you will understand how to monitor the memory consumers in your SQL Server, what are wait types that we need to look for, how to understand if your system is well-tuned and the memory configuration is well defined</description>

specifically: „from address data to data-presentation in SSRS Mapcontrol in 3 steps.“ Each company has address data in the relational form [street], [postcode] und [place]. In a first step the transition to Geodata is presented in the form of longitude and latitude. The question of data source and data quality is also an issue addressed in this section. The next step deals with the selection of appropriate maps. Of special note is the data-matching of the maps with the address data. Also the own production of map sections will be illustrated in an example. The third step is to conduct the use and configuration of the control and the reference to the report data</description>

      <title>Database Replication - What, How and Why</title>
      <description>Database replication doesn't get much attention, especially now that the AlwaysOn features have been released into the wild.  

However, replication offers another way to make data available on multiple servers/locations that steps outside of "normal" HA/DR scenarios.

This session will explain what database replication is, what the different parts are that make up the replication architecture and when/why you would use replication.

The content will be valid for all versions of SQL Server from 2005 onward.</description>

      <description>Building a strong HA/DR solution with SQL Server has never been easier, however when you want to start looking at multi-site and multi-subnet clusters or Availability Groups there are some important things you need to consider. In this session I will show you how to handle some of these considerations and work though getting a reliable multi-site configuration in place without the need for things like stretch VLANs or SAN replication.

We will also look at some of the performance  failover scenarios that you might encounter and just what you should look to do when you need to go to DR.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional vs Tabular - May the Best Model Win</title>
      <description>Are multidimensional models dead on arrival? Are tabular models the future of analysis? Come to this session to learn the similarities and differences between these two approaches to analytical modeling first introduced in SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services. We'll explore the pros and cons of each type of model and review how to select the appropriate model to your analytical requirements.</description>

      <title>INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE - deep dive</title>
      <description>DML is used in  most cases without thinking about the multiple operations for the db engine. This session will give a deep dive into the internal storage engine down to record level.
After finishing the theory (and inside the theory) the differen DML commands and their tremendous operational tasks for the db engine will be investigated.
SEE, what a workload will be caused by a "forwarded record". What tremendous workload will occur in a page split. What happens if an existing record will be updated in fixed length attributes </description>

      <title>Building a meta-driven near realtime ETL solution with BIML and SSIS</title>
      <description>This all demo session will take you through a case of how to build a completely meta-driven SSIS solution relaying on BIML and MDS to do the hard-work for you. Being able to do this and have the system finding the fastest way to load data automatically using system stored procedures enables you to offer near real-time reporting to your users.
Topics covered in the session
* BIML  SSIS
* MDS
* System SPs (especially sp_depends)
* Near Real-time reporting, what it takes and how to do it.</description>

      <title>The nightmare of locking, blocking and isolation levels!</title>
      <description>I am sure you all know that troubleshooting problems related to locking and blocking (hey, sometimes there are deadlocks too) can be a real nightmare! In this session, you will be able to see and understand why and how locking actually works, what problems it causes and how can we use isolation levels and various other techniques to resolve them!</description>

      <title>Columnstore indexes, concepts and evolution </title>
      <description>The Columnstore indexes technology has been introduced in SL Server 2012 and strongly enhanced in SQL 2014. This session illustrate their architecture and will show pros (many) and cons (not so many). Starting from large DWH in SQL Server 2012, a number of OLTP application can now take advantage from this feature to achieve impressive performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Responding to extended events in near real time</title>
      <description>Extended events are really useful for gathering information not available otherwise. However, compared to other technologies such as trace and event notifications, it seems to be lacking a way to react to the events as soon as they happen. In this session we will see how this is possible using the APIs and which new possibilities this approach enables. </description>
