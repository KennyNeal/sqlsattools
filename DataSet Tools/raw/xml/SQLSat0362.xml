      <title>Turbocharge Your Career With a Learning Plan</title>
      <description>What will you learn next quarter and why? How will you learn it? How much time and money will it cost? What is the ROI on learning those skills? Those are the questions that you answer by building a learning plan and, if you do it well, you’ll find yourself steadily pulling away from your peers.

It starts with a learning list, a place to capture skills you think you need to learn. That’s where you score each topic by estimating the effort to learn it in time and money and the value it adds to your career now and later. It’s absolutely an analog process, but it gives you the framework for answering one question: what do I learn next and why?

Once you’ve picked a topic, how do you learn more about it? Do you read blogs, buy books, or attend a class? Or all of the above? How much time makes sense? Join this session and learn how to dig into the topic to answer the questions that lead to a learning plan. After that, it’s just a matter of executing the plan!</description>

      <title>Query Store - A New SQL Query Tuning Feature</title>
      <description>Have you ever come in to work only to have the boss come tell you that your main site is down and the database is "broken"?  Fixing query performance problems can be rough, especially in high-pressure situations.  Microsoft has developed a feature to help customers gain significantly easier insight into production systems and to be able to quickly fix cases where a new plan choice from the query optimizer has undesired performance consequences.  This talk introduces the Query Store, explains the architecture, and shows how it can be used to solve real-world performance problems.  It will now be possible to ask questions like "show me what query plans have changed since yesterday" and to quickly ask the optimizer to "go back" to the query plan that was working fine for you previously.</description>

      <title>No DR Site?! No problem!! Enhance your SQL Server HA/DR capabilities using Windows Azure</title>
      <description>You may already know that Windows Azure cloud service will help you build cost-efficient, scalable and flexible SQL Server solutions. But do you know you can also use it to enhance the High Availability and Disaster Recovery of your SQL Server solutions? In this session, we will show you how you can use the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) capabilities of Windows Azure to build highly scalable and available SQL Servers. We will then take it further to demonstrate how you can use AlwaysOn Availability Groups to improve availability and provide disaster recovery for your SQL Servers either on premise, in the cloud or both (Hybrid). We will also introduce you to the cloud enhancements in SQL Server 2014 that makes deploying databases to Windows Azure and implementing AlwaysON replicas in the cloud merely a child play. We will also look at how Windows Azure Blob Storage provides flexible, reliable off-site storage location for your SQL Server database backups. </description>

      <title>Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml</title>
      <description>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.

      <title>SQL Server 2014 In Memory technologies - In Memory OLTP (aka Hekaton)  ColumnStore</title>
      <description>With the advent of new hardware servers with hundreds of Gigabytes of RAM memory and incredibly faster CPUs with multi-core dies Microsoft has catapulted SQL Server above competitors with some new In Memory technologies. Did you ever want to have no locking, no blocking, no latch? For highly transactional systems, In Memory OLTP can boost performance 10x by hosting a table in memory and compiling the stored procedure in C code/DLL. Did you ever wanted to have queries return blazing fast for slow changing data? Updatable ColumnStore index allows for quick results to be returned as massive compression on the column exist and data is kept in RAM. 
Having participated in SQL14/Hekaton TAP, I'll be showing demo on both of these technologies, gotchas, best practices.</description>

      <title>Capture Change and Apply it with CDC  SSIS</title>
      <description>Whether you are trying to setup a new data warehouse, keep it updated, audit changes to your databases or quickly load changes to another database Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution for all of these and can now be setup and supported easily with SQL Server  SSIS 2012! Change Data Capture (CDC) has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is setup on your databases. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes.</description>

      <title>Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations</title>
      <description>With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.</description>

      <title>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <description>It happens - problems due to changes, be it ALTERed SPs, index rebuilds, or even configuration changes. But what if you could look historically and track down what changes were made when, by who, and from where? What if you could see in realtime when changes occur?  It exists, it's in SQL Server (even standard edition) from 2005-2014, and it's easy to implement. Come learn what Event Notification is and why you'll want it in your environment. This is not theory, all code provided and in production on hundreds of servers in multiple environments.

      <title>Database Release Management: Tips to help organize it</title>
      <description>The very nature of a database system is to be dynamic; rarely static. The applications that use databases tend to change, requiring changes to occur within our databases.  The totality of pieces and parts that comprise this ‘change’ will be combined into a ‘Release’ that will be applied to your systems. Controlling this change is not rocket science, but it is not without its complexities. We will discuss various terms, define processes, share ideas, and suggest tools to assist you in performing this necessary function, while minimizing risk, and impacting your systems in a graceful fashion.</description>

      <description>Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response time performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues.

Then, I’ll show you an easy way to setup your own validation checks using SQL Server’s Policy Based Management feature. Lastly, you’ll learn how you can be part of the CIS Community input. So, bring your current security setting checklist to see if you’ve missed anything or to propose changes in future CIS Security Benchmarks.

      <title>Parameter Sniffing the Good and the Bad</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is something that more than often helps performance on your servers; however, there are times when it can hinder performance as well.    In this session we will define exactly what parameter sniffing is, and examine when it is good and when it is bad.  Lastly, we will explore the different options available to fix bad parameter sniffing.  After this session, you will be able to locate and fix bad parameter sniffing when it occurs on your servers.</description>

      <title>5 TSQL Commands I've Been Missing</title>
      <description>Being a full-stack .NET developer, I have written my fair share of T-SQL, but not until I became an accidental DBA did I find a new world of T-SQL options available to me.   In this session, I will go over a five T-SQL commands available since SQL Server 2005 and up that I have been completely missing.  We will evaluate the usefulness of  CTE, OUTPUT, MERGE, APPLY, and RANKING FUNCTIONS and how each of these can replace common cases you see everyday.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Foreign Keys – De-mystifying the Rest of the Story</title>
      <description>Foreign Keys have a bad rap – they cause performance issues, they inhibit some inserts, deletes and updates, etc.  This may be true, but let’s further explore why we even have them and how they can benefit and maybe even improve performance.  This session will concentrate on many demos including the attributes associated with foreign keys.  The attendee will walk away from this session with a better understanding of Foreign Key utility and their maintenance. </description>

      <title>SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?</title>
      <description>For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.</description>
