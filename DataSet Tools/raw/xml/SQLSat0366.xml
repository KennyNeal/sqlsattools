      <title>Best Practices for Fabric Configuration of SQL Server Workloads in Private Cloud Environments</title>
      <description>As you migrate SQL Server workloads to a private cloud, many questions arise on how to best configure the virtualization host and virtual machines to get the best performance possible.  Further, questions around how the physical architecture impacts to the virtual environment and vice versa need to be addressed in order to ensure the organization reaps the benefits of cloud computing.  

In this session you will learn how to configure the four key fabric resources (CPU, memory, disk, and network) to enable best performance for your SQL Server workloads.  We will also cover how to avoid the little "gotchas" that could really cause you headaches.   Find out the impact of NUMA architecture on VM configuration, how to leverage storage capabilities in Windows Server 2012 R2 to enable robust performance, how SR-IOV and RDMA can help boost network performance, and much more.  You will also learn how to extend your architecture to Microsoft Azure to allow for additional capabilities.</description>

      <title>The Restore Cookbook</title>
      <description>How do you restore a database that has lost a file? How do you recover from a lost transaction log? How do you get rid of corruption in the fastest time?

At some point in time, these and other destructive scenarios will happen to your databases. And people will look at you and expect you to react swiftly and confidently.

In this session we will demo these scenarios from disaster to resolution. Because if we are the guardians of our SQL Servers then we should all know these recipes.</description>

      <title>Configuring SharePoint 2013 as a BI Platform</title>
      <description>With SharePoint as the business collaboration platform of choice for the enterprise, it has become an important piece in the overall Microsoft BI stack. However, deploying and configuring it to support Microsoft BI solutions has become a cumbersome task for the IT professional. 

In this session, you will learn what it takes to successfully architect and design SharePoint 2013 as a BI platform. We will cover multiple configuration scenarios and the different technologies necessary to build the infrastructure. At the end of the session, you can walk away feeling confident to run Power Pivot, Power View and Reporting Services in your SharePoint 2013 farm.</description>

      <title>Query Plans and Indexes in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Data access can be easy to set up in your applications with wizards and ORMs, but sometimes your queries are just not as fast as you think they should be – especially on those tables that are getting bigger and bigger. In this session, we will take a peek under the hood and see how SQL server answers the questions you ask of it. This is an introductory session, but it will be jam-packed with demos and useful tips that you will be able to use to make your applications more responsive.</description>

      <title>DAX and the tabular model</title>
      <description>With the advent of the tabular model in SQL Server 2012, another analytical option has opened to the BI Specialist. We shall be looking at what critical factors should be analyzed prior to opting for the model and that done,  how to extract data from a tabular model using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).
We shall discuss many of the often used functions, discuss their 'overloads' (utilizing several practical examples) and see how to turn the extracted data into valuable information that may be used by decision makers to help the enterprise achieve its corporate goals.</description>

      <description>We know BI in bits and pieces. But imagine if you had to setup the BI infrastructure from scratch. 
What do we need to consider, which players do we consider, what are the components, the HA/DR scenario for the same, what technology to use? These are the questions we will attempt to answer along the way.
What are the best practices involved in creating a BI infrastructure. We can discuss whether to outsource this project or rise above our DBA job and do it ourselves.</description>
