We're masters of googling solutions to our problems and make sure our complex ETL processes run without errors. We deliver data to business users... but we don't deliver data as fast as we want. 
 
You might not be able to rewrite your entire data warehouse or change your team's processes over night, but there are many things you can do to increase your own productivity and become a more efficient data warehouse developer. 
 
In this session I will show you some of what I've learned and discovered that has made me burst out "Oh wow! Why did I not know this yesterday!?" including query improvements, free tools and scripts, SSMS features and even a couple of things I used to think were only useful for those scary DBAs. </description>

      <title>Analizing Text with SQL Server 2014 and R</title>
      <description>Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media. Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. Free statistical package / language R is also useful for the text mining tasks. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with the tools mentioned.</description>

      <title>Azure Big Data Solution – automation of deployment</title>
      <description>By now you’ve probably heard about Big Data 1.000 times or more so why a new session about big data you might ask.
Show how to make creation and deletion of AZURE elements automatically as part of your ETL process or by Powershell, automate the trivial procedures and work on the interesting parts
 This session will show you how :
• Downloads and prepares several years of demo data and storing it in a dedicated Azure Blob Storage account.
• Create a storage account and container for the HDInsight Cluster.
• Create a SQL database server instance and a SQL database for the Hive Metastore. We will also setup the necessary firewall rules so that you can access the server directly.
• The HDInsight cluster is provisioned and configured for access to the sample data.
• A partitioned Hive table is created over top of the sample data 
• Exploration of the result
• And how to automate these task either in Powershell or SSIS.

      <title>Triple Trouble - Running a SQL Failover Cluster on a Cluster from a Cluster</title>
      <description>SQL Server Failover Clustering has traditionally been deployed on physical architecture for a very long time, and is considered by many to be the optimal architectural deployment even today.

Experienced High Availability implementors and pioneers will remember the Microsoft Cluster Hardware Compatibility List with terror and early Virtualization adopters will recoil in disgust at their memories of poorly performing SQL Server VM deployments and will never want to go back there again. Times are changing and with the introduction of Microsoft's Scalable Shared File Server and improvements to Hyper-V Clustering, High Availability will never be the same again.

In this session we will investigate whether times have really changed for the better and discuss how to implement, administrate and benefits of running a Cluster on a Cluster from a Cluster!</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014 and Ascending Key Problem in Large Tables</title>
      <description>The SQL Server Query Optimizer relies on distribution statistics to create the query execution plan. But statistics are almost always out-of-date. For columns with ascending keys the most recent rows don’t exist for statistics objects. And common queries are looking for those rows. This can lead to poorly-performing plans, especially for large tables, where for instance a query that returns a few recent orders for a customer takes several seconds, with a few million logical reads.
In this session we’ll show how to identify columns with ascending keys and also query patterns where this problem occurs. Of course we’ll see how to get well performing plans with the queries in SQL Server 2012. According to documentation about new features in SQL Server 2014 the problem seems to be solved in the latest SQL Server version. But is this really so? What is different in SQL Server 2014? Does the problem still occur? As you guess, all those questions will be addressed and answered in this session</description>

      <title>Advanced Execution Plan Analysis</title>
      <description>If you have been working with SQL Server for a while now, you probably already know the basics of reading execution plans.  You know what most of the common operators do, at least in outline, and you know some of the things to look out for and correct. Even so, you still encounter plans from time to time that contain mysterious elements, or which just do not make complete sense to you.

There is always more to know about query plans and the execution engine, but this session will help take your query analysis skills on to the next level. We will look at some of the less well-known operators and plan properties, then explore advanced plan sub-tree shapes and the T-SQL constructions they are most often associated with. Becoming familiar with these details will enable you to write T-SQL that targets a more optimal execution plan.</description>

      <title>Exploring the SQL Server Source Code</title>
      <description>SQL Server is (sadly) not an open source product, so we cannot simply download the source code from microsoft.com to see exactly how it works internally. However, Microsoft do helpfully provide public debugging symbols for every released version (including service packs and cumulative updates).

The public symbols only list module and method names, not every line of code, but the exposed names are sufficiently descriptive that the patient symbols-equipped explorer can gain some useful insights to the way SQL Server works at a very low level of detail.

This demo-heavy session will use the WinDbg debugger from the Debugging Tools for Windows to explore how the SQL Server Query Processor interacts with the Storage Engine to run execution plans. You will see how execution plans run left to right, row-by-row, and see a number of interesting internal details of the complex implementation that lies behind the apparent simplicity of graphical execution plans.</description>

      <title>Drinking from the Azure Data Streams</title>
      <description>Deriving value from your data can be hard even when the data is stood still.  Trying to get insight from your data when it is constantly changing and moving is even more challenging.  Being able to derive business value from your data as soon as the data is produced can offer real actionable insight.  Imagine being able to action telemetry data coming from machines in your factory or being able to post trades by looking at real time market positions.
 
This session is going to look at a couple of ways to do real time analysis on your streaming data.  We will capture the data, perform analysis on the data and also look at visualizing the data.

      <title>My first data science experiment using Azure Machine Learning</title>
      <description>You have invested tons into your datawarehouse, only to build static reports in SSRS. That’s sad! After all, a good star schema is the perfect foundation to easy Machine Learning. So let’s do what the analysts say and leverage all that potential synergies, directly into the Cloud! ;)
Well, at least, let’s talk about Machine Learning, in words understandable by BI professionals, and check out what Azure ML is all about.

      <title>INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE - deep dive</title>
      <description>DML is used in  most cases without thinking about the multiple operations for the db engine. This session will give a deep dive into the internal storage engine down to record level.
After finishing the theory (and inside the theory) the differen DML commands and their tremendous operational tasks for the db engine will be investigated.
SEE, what a workload will be caused by a "forwarded record". What tremendous workload will occur in a page split. What happens if an existing record will be updated in fixed length attributes </description>

      <description>Getting the right data in the right format is critical for all data analytics. PowerQuery helps you to achieve this. Using the GUI to do this is one thing. To use the tool to its full potential you want to use M, the language behind PowerQuery. In this demo rich session we will start simple by doing some data transformations in the GUI. We will then dive into M to get to the real powerful stuff.</description>

      <title>Analysis Services: Choosing between Multidimensional and Tabular</title>
      <description>Since SQL Server 2012, Analysis Services has two different modeling approaches for data analysis: Multidimensional and Tabular. Despite having the same purpose and very similar features between them, you can actually get a lot of benefits by choosing the model that best fits your project requirements. To help you on this big decision, we will compare their features, modeling experience, server requirements, processing and querying performance, and so on, by using a real scenario.</description>

      <title>Query Optimizer internals</title>
      <description>The query optimizer is at the heart of SQLServer.  Without it SQLServer would be a vastly inferior product, queries would have to be manually tuned at each and every turn, and generally speaking, the optimizer protects us from the complexities and mechanics involved.

Much of the optimizer's internal workings are hidden from the user, but can be revealed by using a selection of undocumented trace flags to gain further knowledge and insight into how your queries and data are processed to create a plan.

This session will be a deep dive into the optimizers' internals and not for the feint of heart.

How batch mode leverages modern CPUs will be described along with the pressure points batch mode places on the CPU, to help illustrate this tooling will be used which goes to a level deeper than that which anything furnished by Windows or SQL Server can provide.</description>
