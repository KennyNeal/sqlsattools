      <title>Performance Tuning Pit Stop for DBAs</title>
      <description>Our users are in constant demand of faster running servers that spill out data before they can blink. Performance can be hard to measure and improve.  Before we get in the race we will cover how to get a Performance baseline using the PAL Tools. The first Pit Stop will be to review TempDB setup to improve performance. Before getting into high gear we'll pull over to refuel on some Log File best practices and performance implications of VLFs. Finally before passing the checkered flag we'll make one more stop to talk about Data Files and improving your mileage from there. After this session you'll have a good idea of how to make changes transparent to any application to get your server crossing that finish line in style!

      <title>How In-Memory Database Objects Affect Database Design</title>
      <description>With SQL Server 2014, Microsoft has added a major new feature to help optimize OLTP database implementations by persisting your data primarily in RAM. Of course it isn't that simple, internally everything that uses this new feature is completely new. While the internals of this feature may be foreign to you, accessing the data that uses the structures very much resembles T-SQL as you already know it. As such, the first important question for the average developer will be how to adapt an existing application to make use of the technology to achieve enhanced performance. In this session, I will start with a normalized database, and adapt the logical and physical database model/implementation in several manners, performance testing the tables and code changes along the way.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Dirty Data with SQL Server and SSIS</title>
      <description>Dirty data is everywhere, and it's headed for a database near you. Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) can be difficult, but often the most challenging component of that process is the validation and clean up of data. Information must be cleansed in such a way that it retains its original message and business value, while conforming to the expectations of the destination system(s).

In this session, we'll discuss some design patterns for addressing different types of dirty data using SQL Server Integration Services. We will review the various cleansing tools accessible from within SSIS including native Integration Services components, T-SQL, and SSIS scripting. In addition, we'll briefly review the new SQL Server Data Quality Services and its integration with SSIS. We'll cap off the discussion with demonstrations of several methods for data cleansing.</description>

      <title>From Zero to Loading a Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>You're tasked to create the ETL process for a brand-new data warehouse. Where do you start? Data warehouse ETL boils down to three specific problems: Staging, Dimensions, and Facts. This session will show you solutions to these three problems. You'll first learn the fundamentals of a data warehouse before diving into creating packages and leveraging common patterns. You'll see both simple and advanced scenarios such as incrementally loading staging tables, processing type1 and type2 slowly changing dimensions, early arriving facts, snapshot fact tables, and bridge tables. If you want to create scalable and efficient SSIS packages to load a data warehouse, this session is for you.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>Hacking Exposé - Using SSL to Protect SQL Connections</title>
      <description>Are you someone (A DBA, Developer, etc) that connects to SQL Server to use data?
You probably hear a lot about how protected your database can be when at rest. But what about when you connect to SQL and start running some queries?
Using a simple hacking technique we will dig into some packets on our network and see what's in them. You may be shocked! Then we will create a self-signed SSL certificate, use it to encrypt our connections on the SQL Server,  and see the actual changes in the packet as hackers would.
*Warning - do not try some of these demos at work without proper permissions as hacking techniques are used.

      <title>ETL Design Topics - Staging</title>
      <description>The staging area of the data warehouse is an often under-utilized tool in the ETL developers tool belt.  It can be used to optimize ETL performance while limiting impact on source systems.  It can be used to identify data quality concerns before they hit the target load process.  It can be used as a supplemental repository for unintegrated data.  This discussion will cover several common and some not-so-common patterns in the design and use of stage tables within the ETL process and the audience will come away with new ideas and core concepts to put to immediate use.</description>

      <title>Automated SQL Server installation and configuration using PowerShell</title>
      <description>Using the SQL setup wizard and management studio (SSMS) to install and configure a new SQL server is a time-intensive process.  PowerShell scripts can greatly reduce the time required to complete the process.  They can also ensure build standardization throughout your SQL environment.  In this session we will look at PowerShell scripting, including the basic syntax and commandlets needed to automate the installation and post-install configuration of a SQL Server.</description>

      <title>APPLY Yourself</title>
      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>

      <description>What is potentially our biggest problem with transactional replication? You guessed it...it breaks! It may break for a variety of reasons and we as DBA’s probably have experienced them all at one point or another. Our biggest worry? Bringing replication back online whenever a full snapshot reinitialization is not an option due to time or space concerns. But don't you worry; we have a couple of tricks up our sleeves! During this session, we will go over options available to you to re-sync your replication with minimal downtime for your production environments.</description>

      <title>Query Tuning - Get it Right the First Time </title>
      <description>SQL Server query tuning is often more art than science and it can quickly eat up a lot of DBA and/or Developer time. This presentation will outline a method for determining the best approach for tuning queries by utilizing response time analysis and SQL diagramming techniques. Regardless of the complexity of the statement, this quick, systematic approach will lead you down the correct tuning path with no guessing. If you are a beginner or expert, this approach will save you countless hours tuning a query.

      <title>Know Your Role(s)!</title>
      <description>Developers and DBAs naturally conflict with each other over permissions since developers want to be able to fix their code and research issues, but DBAs are the gatekeepers.  In this session we will discuss Microsoft recommended best practices for setting up users and service account permissions.  We will go over common server and database roles and what they actually allow, including roles that should be avoided as potential security loopholes.  He will also look into alternatives for elevated database roles, and easier ways of setting up users across an enterprise environment, all as part of how to consolidate your development servers into fewer instances.</description>

      <title>Query Compilation and Plan Caching</title>
      <description>SQL Server often appears to be a black box. Queries go in and results come out. But a lot goes into making that happen. In this session, we will take a look at the stages that SQL Server goes through when it compiles a query plan and some of the optimization that can be used. Once compiled the plans can be cached for reuse. I will explain where the plans get cached to and how SQL Server knows when it can re-use a plan.</description>

      <title>De-Mystifying SQL Server Statistics</title>
      <description>In order to build optimal query plans the SQL Server optimizer relies on statistics to estimate the size of the query workload, which determines the resources that get allocated to the query.

This session will demonstrate how to determine if your statistics are current, how to make them current, and how bad things can happen when they are not current.</description>
