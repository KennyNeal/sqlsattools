      <title>Introduction to Biml  BimlScript</title>
      <description>Within every Data Warehouse project there is always ETL development that is very repetitive in nature, for example, you need to import 20 different flat file exports from the ERP system, you need to load 15 dimensions into the data warehouse and so on.
With Microsoft SSIS out-of-the-box, you are forced to create multiple individual packages which is very time consuming due to the lack of easy code reuse. In a typical BI project, the ETL implementation can easily take up 60% of the project time, so it is beneficial if the development time of similar SSIS packages can be cut down.
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML dialect for defining Business Intelligence assets across the Microsoft SQL Server platform
In this session Craig will introduce you to Biml  BimlScript, providing those new to Biml with a foundational understanding of what BIML is and what the benefits of using Biml are.

      <description>Historically, users have been constrained to consume data in fixed platforms, with one specific dimension for digital viewings and a couple of printed layouts. Nowadays, with the ubiquitous mobile devices available, Management expects to know key business indicators and day-to-day operation performance on the go. Using well-designed data models and visualization techniques, Power View can leverage timely and quick dashboards for analysis on the go.   
  
This session will discuss how to design the appropriate data model to enable self-service data exploration and insightful analysis in Power View, and how to create pixel perfect visualization for mobile devices. You will also learn how the techniques differ from traditional platforms. Using live demo, we will walk through ways to channel users focus on actionable analytics.  </description>

      <title>Thinking Out of the Box: Manage SQL Server Using Built-in Tools</title>
      <description>It’s often the case that your budget doesn’t stretch far enough for all the great third party tools that help manage your SQL Servers. So, how can the in-built components of SQL Server help you with your daily tasks?

Policy Management, Data Collector and Extended Events, all included in both Enterprise and Standard Editions, provide a framework to keep your configurations consistent and give you some insights into the performance of your SQL Server instances. In this session, we will see how to make use of these components to formalize your configuration and track some performance attributes.

After this session you’ll be able to build out an effective management and monitoring toolkit using only “out-of-the-box” features.</description>

      <title>TOPGUN SQL SERVER: Unlocking the Fighter Pilot in Every DBA</title>
      <description>UNLOCKING THE FIGHTER PILOT IN EVERY DBA – Let’s discuss how piloting tactical jets and flying SQL Servers requires similar psychology, skills and composure, especially during emergencies! DBA performance in production environments matters greatly, even on the easiest of days. But when things go wrong, that’s when you really earn your money and discover the depth of your knowledge and your poise in emergency response. We’ll focus on improving successful handling of critical situations. Content is based upon the collective knowledge gained by many people over many years in high performance aircraft. We’ll investigate examples of how to, and how not to, handle extremely difficult situations. We will look at bullet proof techniques for improving DBA crisis management. We’ll dig into teamwork/crew coordination during critical scenarios. Get ready for takeoff as you’ll see some captivating flight video and, if you have the courage to, participate in a live exercise.</description>

      <title>Continuously Integrated Data Vault</title>
      <description>In this double session using a live-typing approach, we will show the overall structure of a Biml file and the core syntax patterns. Then he will demonstrate how the power of BimlScript is amplified by the availability of rich metadata sources to drive the automatic creation of your Data Vault solution. 

We will demonstrate a flexible and reusable framework for storing and managing the metadata that you will use as an input to your BimlScripts. We will bring it together with a walking through a fully featured production framework and the code it generates.

We will add unit test and continuous integration using MSBuild and the BimlCompiler allowing for changes in the source to drive the re-factoring of your Data Vault development.

      <title>Building Hybrid BI Solutions with Power BI</title>
      <description>As organizations look to lower infrastructure costs and increase worker productivity, two industry trends have emerged: the shift to the cloud and self-service. How will these trends change the way we build BI solutions, without compromising on security, manageability and governance? Join this session and find out! We will explore the following questions: What is Power BI? What do you need to run Power BI? How does Power BI differ to traditional BI? Where does Power BI fit in a broader enterprise BI strategy? And, finally, how can on-premises data sources be used in cloud-based Power BI solutions? In addition to answering these questions, we will build a Power BI solution from scratch using both on-premises and cloud-based data sources. We will use Power Query, Power Pivot, Power View and Power Map, before deploying the solution to a Power BI site in the cloud, and interacting with it using Q  A, the new natural language query technology.</description>

      <title>Data Warehouse Automation - Improving your productivity</title>
      <description>In this session we will discuss Data Warehouse Automation, how it can improve you productivity as a developer and, 
at the same time, produce a consistent and flexible Data Warehouse that's easy to change. 

In the session we will build a Data Warehouse using a Data Warehouse Automation tool, so you can see the process in action. 

We will also look at EzAPI an alternative to BIML, that you can use to generate SSIS packages. Using EzAPI you can save time by starting with a standard SSIS package as a template, and then modify through code. 

Data Warehouse Automation lets you stay focused on what really matters... producing valuable analytics and reporting for your business users</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Azure Machine Learning</title>
      <description>"A Festivus for the rest of us!". That was how Seinfeld character Frank Costanza described his alternative to the Christmas tradition. In this session, I'll describe an alternative to the traditional approach to Data Science. Armed with nothing but a browser and an internet connection, I'll show you how easy it is to use Azure Machine Learning to build cloud-powered predictive models and deploy them as web services for application integration.  After setting the context of where predictive modelling fits in the overall analytics spectrum, we'll dive into the Azure offering, before building and deploying a machine learning model from scratch using Azure Machine Learning Studio.</description>

      <title>Powershell Gems for the DBA</title>
      <description>Over the last 5 years Powershell has become the “go to” tool for the automation and management of the Windows platform and SQL Server.
In this session we will walk through a number of Powershell functions, code snippets and techniques that can help fast track the development of automation and management DBA scripts. The examples in the session will show case Powershell building blocks like logging, exclude/include lists, read/validate INI files, retries, report generation, data load of performance data etc.
