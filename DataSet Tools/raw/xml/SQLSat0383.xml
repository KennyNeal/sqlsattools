      <description>I#39;m a DBA who has gone through most of my career with few people to learn and unsure of where to find great help until I found a real mentor.  When I started at a company with a great, knowledgeable manager and learned to find others speaking about SQL Server online my skills boomed.  This is especially true in my most passionate area, SQL Server performance.  

Knowing that my knowledge came from others, I now have a second passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</description>

      <title>XML Without Xanax: How to Handle XML in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Do you cringe whenever you have to look at an XML document? Does the very thought of XML data living in your database make you scream? Do you have a panic attack any time you have to parse XML? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this session is for you!

We'll start with reasons why having XML in SQL Server might be a good thing, then we'll face our fears and turn tabular data into XML, and finally we'll confront the true source of our anxiety by parsing XML back into tabular data using xQuery.

If you survive this session, you'll have faced your fears about XML in SQL Server, you'll have a solid understanding of creating XML from tabular data, and you'll know how to use xQuery to parse XML.</description>

      <title>Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine</title>
      <description>Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.</description>

      <title>Rethink Your ETL with BIML</title>
      <description>It's estimated that 70% of data warehousing development is in ETL (extract, transformation, and load) between the different source systems, your data warehouse, and/or your data mart. Recently a new tool has entered the marked that promised to revolutionize the way we think about ETL processes. Gone are the days where we need to manually code every component, every event handler, and painstakingly ensure that every package adheres to corporate standards. In this session, Chris will introduce you to the world of BIML and how it can change your world. We'll show you how to quickly create a template in BIML that will make sure all of your packages adhere to corporate standards, and then use metadata to quickly generate dozens of packages to populate your dimensions and facts. Stop spending weeks developing SSIS packages that can be built in hours! You won't want to miss this session!

      <title>Hacking Exposé - Using SSL to Protect SQL Connections</title>
      <description>Are you someone (A DBA, Developer, etc) that connects to SQL Server to use data?
You probably hear a lot about how protected your database can be when at rest. But what about when you connect to SQL and start running some queries?
Using a simple hacking technique we will dig into some packets on our network and see what's in them. You may be shocked! Then we will create a self-signed SSL certificate, use it to encrypt our connections on the SQL Server,  and see the actual changes in the packet as hackers would.
*Warning - do not try some of these demos at work without proper permissions as hacking techniques are used.

      <title>Geekin’ Out on Extended Events -Deconstructing the system_health session to solve performance issues</title>
      <description>Extended Events are used to gather a wide range of performance information to help troubleshoot performance problems in SQL Server. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. This session starts automatically when the SQL Server database engine starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. This presentations will take you on an in-depth tour of the data provided in the system_health event session and how to use it to troubleshoot performance issues. Cases studies from real-life examples will be used to demonstrate tips and tricks.</description>

      <title>Possible Musics:  SSAS Multidimensional vs Tabular</title>
      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI. BI professionals can implement Multidimensional cubes, or they can deploy Tabular models developed by business users to a dedicated server. Those new to Tabular, or those embarking upon BI for the first time with SSAS 2012, may find it difficult to choose between the two paths. In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and SSAS Maestro Bill Pearson overviews the nature and design goals of each option, comparing Multidimensional and Tabular features. He then offers guidance on selecting the appropriate model, providing examples to illustrate approaches for given scenarios.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MDX</title>
      <description>In this session, led by Microsoft BI Architect and SQL Server MVP Bill Pearson, we will concentrate largely upon crafting simple MDX expressions and queries whose purposes, for the most part, are to return a set of data. We will overview the structure of a cube, using as a basis the sample Adventure Works cube that is available to anyone installing SQL Server Analysis Services 2008 R2. We will then outline the components of simple MDX syntax, and get started writing basic expressions and queries. We will expose basic member functions, introduce filters (or “slicers”), and begin exploring core MDX functionality, including calculated members, and named sets.   This session applies equally to Analysis Services 2008, 2008R2 and 2012.</description>

      <title>The Quest for the Golden Record: MDM Best Practices </title>
      <description>In this session, we will focus on how to formulate a Master Data Management (MDM) strategy and build a solution to find the single version of the truth, aka the Golden Record. While these techniques can apply to any domain, we will demonstrate building a sample customer domain in this session, showing how to leverage SQL Server Master Data Services(MDS) and other tools for data quality, matching, and de-duplication across multiple data sources. </description>

      <title>Introduction to Window Functions</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world. </description>

      <title>DBA 911 - Database Corruption</title>
      <description>Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption.  In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands, monitoring for corruption with SQL Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when to restore versus repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for corruption, identify different types of corruption, and take the appropriate measures for dealing with it.

      <title>Boosting DWH-Performance with SQL Server 2014</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2014 is all about in-memory. Not that previous versions did not hold as much as data as possible inside of memory through caching, but now we enter a new era: columnar storage, in-memory tables and compiled stored procedures are different from what we have seen so far. In this session, you will see how you can leverage those new features and how you can come by existing limitations. Come back to office with the knowledge how to boost the performance of your ETL, queries and reports into the new era.</description>

      <description>How SQL Server performs I/O

How is SQL Server really accessing the data and log files on the disk? What's done asynchronous and what's  synchronous and what impact does that have on our queries and DML statements.
Which impact have features  like database mirroring and replication, what's different when SQL Server is starting up.
 
Which I/O Subsystems (including SSD) are best for which type of data and what's the impact if you choose a different one.  Which files can be placed on the same volume and which should not.

      <title>Getting started with SSIS</title>
      <description>Integration services is a powerful tool for visualizing and handling most of your SQL Server ETL needs. But Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) can be a confusing tool the first time that you start the application. There's a LOT going on, and for the first time developer, it's not very clear how to get started. This session will help get you on your feet developing SSIS packages. We will look at some common scenarios and live demo creating your first SSIS packages to copy data from one server to another, extract data to a flat file, and learn how to solve some common errors. Feel free to bring your questions on getting started with BIDS.</description>

      <title>Level Up: Understanding Azure's SQL Database Service Tiers</title>
      <description>As part of Microsoft's aggressive cloud strategy, the SQL Database as a service has been getting new releases and new features at a rapid pace.

The biggest change so far has been the introduction of three service tiers: Basic, Standard and Premium.

Gone is the pay for database size system and it has been replaced by a system where we also pay for the performance characteristics and recovery features of our database.

Come learn the differences between the tiers, measuring performance and how to optimize the use of your cloud SQL power.</description>

      <title>APPLY Yourself</title>
      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>

      <title>Much Ado About Hadoop</title>
      <description>Hadoop is a hot topic right now, and Microsoft is betting that Hadoop and SQL Server will go together like peanut butter and chocolate.  This presentation will spend a little bit of time on the theory behind Hadoop, but the rest will be a demo-driven look at how to get a handle on Hadoop before somebody introduces it into your enterprise.</description>

      <title>SQL Server and Networking High Availability/Disaster Recovery Best Practices</title>
      <description>Do you think you can handle Failover Clustering and Availability Groups? Think again. Your job description as a SQL Server DBA has just changed. In this demo-centric session, you’ll see how networking aspects such as Active Directory and DNS play very important roles when implementing a SQL Server high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR) solution. You will want to be confident enough to have a conversation with your Domain Administrator to make sure your SQL Server databases meet their recovery objectives and service level agreements. </description>

      <title>Fixing Page Life Expectancy</title>
      <description>Starting with what Page Life Expectancy really means to query, server, and disk performance, we’ll get a firm understanding of what this counter means to you. After that we can start talking about if and how you want to raise it. It’s important to know that this is just a counter and there are situations where you don’t care about it nearly as much as you’d expect. It’s also important to know what effect a drop in PLE mid-day really means beyond query performance, including a possible impact on other, unrelated servers.</description>

      <title>Building dynamic SSIS packages for more flexibility</title>
      <description>After building a handful of SSIS packages, you probably want to have more flexibility to make the package execution more dynamic.  In this session, we will learn how to use  variables, expressions, and loops to do things like: extract data to a file with *today's* date in the file name, load all files in a directory at the same time, and loop through a set of servers to gather data.  For this session, you should already be familiar with how to create SSIS packages to load data from flat files and extract data to flat files.</description>

      <title>Advanced Troubleshooting Your SQL Connections</title>
      <description>Often in supporting SQL Server, we are asked to troubleshoot why a user or application cannot connect.  It becomes more challenging when we find nothing is wrong with the way SQL Server is running.  In this session we review common mistakes to the configuration of network settings.  We’ll also show how to troubleshoot the SQL Server Browser.  We’ll cover how to test for firewall issues.  Finally we’ll discuss why SQL Server is blamed for dropping its connections.</description>
