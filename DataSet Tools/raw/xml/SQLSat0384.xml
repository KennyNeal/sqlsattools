      <title>Deadlocks. Everything that developer needs to know.</title>
      <description>It's no secret that a deadlock - it's not very good. This is an exceptional situation, when two concurrent queries request same resources, but in a different order. Classic deadlock can occur when two concurrent transactions modifying data from the two tables in a different order. Unfortunately in a real life deadlocks can be more complex and unobvious. One of the rules, which I always keep in mind, sounds: " You can not design a database, in which the occurrence of deadlock is impossible". And we should deal with them. The algorithm is simple: catch, analyze, fix. But in practice the process can be challenging and can require different types of analysis. In this session we will analyse and solve as many deadlock as we can in 60 min.</description>

      <title>Memory-Optimized tables - Querying at the speed of light</title>
      <description>One of Microsoft SQL Server 2014âs big features was the all new In-Memory OLTP (or Hekaton) addition to the SQL Server engine. Microsoft estimates a query performance increase of 5-to-20 times by just putting your disk-based tables into the RAM of your server! If we can gain that much of a performance increase that easily, then why arenât Memory-Optimized tables the default go-to solution for all your performance problems? Because, of-course, it isnât as easy as just a drag-and-drop to move your tables from disk into memoryâ¦

Transforming your disk-based tables to Memory-Optimized tables takes careful planning and a good understanding of the limitations and restrictions of In-Memory OLTP. In this demo-filled session, we will take a look underneath the hood of Memory-Optimized tables, helping you with the first steps towards light speed querying!</description>

      <title>SQL Server  Power BI Geographic and Temporal Predictions</title>
      <description>Data science, predictive analytics, insights, statisticsâ¦ There are so many buzzwords around these days. These words are frequently used in an introduction to some technical article, at the beginning of a presentation, and even in regular talk. However, when it comes down to a real analysis, you typically get reports with very nice Power BI graphs, but without real forecasting. It is up to you to recognize the patterns and then probably make some kind of interpolation by yourself. Data mining is the part that is based on statistics and can really make forecasts automatically. Data mining is part of SSAS installed in multidimensional mode. Is it possible to get the best from both words? This advanced session explains the forecasting algorithms and shows how you can integrate geographic and temporal predictions in Power View and Power Map visualizations and interactive animations. Popular buzzwords finally get some real meat behind them.</description>

      <title>Lets cook SQL Server Management practices for the Non-DBA </title>
      <description>DBA trade is still in-demand and will remain as long as databases are alive!
If you are an average IT person/Developer/SysAdmin who has been managing development and databases in your organisation, now you want to manage SQL Server databases using tricks of DBA trade and you've got no idea what to do with it!

In this session we will overview range of topics that every DBA handles, such as: backup/restore strategy, high availability, scalability and performance tuning. We will touch base on how best SQL Server technology will offer home-grown tools to keep your BAU tasks.

Not giving opportunity of riding a super-duper car, but best learning techniques on how to manage your SQL Server database and make it efficient enough to run like a fast car on performance aspects. You will get o know what is needed to get that new features to implement, how best they can fit in.

All the examples and demos in this session are originated from real-world work from my Consulting experience.</description>

      <title>BIML â the best friend of SSIS developers</title>
      <description>Many BI developers use SSIS. It's great tool. But exists many routine tasks. For example, you need create package for incremental updating of 10 tables. You did it. But structure of tables was changed. Or you need add to package 5 (or may be 50) additional tables. In this situation you need help. And you have new assistant. His name is BIML (Business Intelligence Markup Language).</description>

      <title>Managing 999 MS SQL Servers</title>
      <description>Managing many SQL server instances is difficult and more importantly it requires a lot of efforts from the DBAs. How can we reduce and save these efforts? Letâs dive into a session covering some great examples and best practices of multi-server management â from building a Central Management Server through gathering performance data with customized Management Data Warehouse. We will do also a showcase for proactive capacity management and see many other ideas for automating of the daily DBA tasks.</description>

      <title>Transactional replication. It's not scary.</title>
      <description>When I've encountered with replication first time, I've thought "Hmm, replication is not so hard for configuring and troubleshooting". It was mistake :).The replication is not as easy to understand from the first time. The next moment  when you got problem with it, such as desync of data between publishers and subscribers and vise versa. Replication sometimes is not readily to troubleshooting. 

In the presentation I'll tell you about transactional replication, about what is it, how to configure different replication schemas and how to determine the cause of problem which can arise.</description>

      <title>Boosting DWH-Performance with SQL Server 2014</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2014 is all about in-memory. Not that previous versions did not hold as much as data as possible inside of memory through caching, but now we enter a new era: columnar storage, in-memory tables and compiled stored procedures are different from what we have seen so far. In this session, you will see how you can leverage those new features and how you can come by existing limitations. Come back to office with the knowledge how to boost the performance of your ETL, queries and reports into the new era.</description>

      <title>Data quality with DQS components in Integration Services</title>
      <description>To integrate data quality in ETL-Jobs some preliminary considerations and preparatory work are necessary. The session shows the preparing steps on DataQualityClient, continues with configuration of some validation-rules and then uses the configuration for a first data-import in SSIS.
The DQS meta-information (stored in a DQS-project) is subsequently evaluated by Data-Stuard (a new role of staff member in the companyâs organigramm).
The result of the evaluation is imported via DQS_stagingDB into DQS_Main Database. This provides import after import, i.e. with each ETL-job there is a continuous improvement of data quality.</description>

      <description>SQL Server indexing is an art. Choosing the right index for the right solution might just not be enough. Options are also without boundaries, but still there are several rules you must always apply to design an effective indexing strategy. Join me in this session and find out about these rules, how the SQL Server optimizer chooses an index and most importantly - is your index useful enough or is just a burden to your database. </description>

      <title>Find and tune those queries!</title>
      <description>There are queries that we usually play a mouse and cat game with, while trying to catch them! When the query is performing badly every time it executes, it is easy to find and tune it. But it could be difficult to isolate those that have inconsistent execution behavior. What is the problem with them, do we need to re-write, to plan guide or to create yet another index? Well, you need to find them first. In this session you will learn how to find and tune queries with inconsistent execution behavior and how to tune them. Getting a predictable query response time is one of the main goals of performance tuning and optimization and this session will definitely help you achieve that goal.</description>
