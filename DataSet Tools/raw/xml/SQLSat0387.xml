      <description>I live in Central Illinois where I was born, originally from Springfield, Illinois.  I started working with SQL Server in 1996 with version 4.2.1 and quickly moved into SQL Server 6.5.  I've been a jack of all trades developing windows applications and databases, and then moved to mainly developing database solutions with DTS, SSIS and SSRS.

I've always said that I want to give my customers the tools to do their jobs.

While I'm not working, I'm an avid sailboat racer in the Star Class.  I've sailed all around the United States and competed in the 1999 Star Class World Championships in Punta Ala, Italy.  Check out starclass.org.  I've been sailing since I was 5 years old and taught sailing for 8 years.  </description>

      <title>Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine</title>
      <description>Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.</description>

      <title>Getting Top Performance from SQL Reporting Service</title>
      <description>You’re a DBA at your company, and you’re in charge of keeping the production SQL servers humming. You know how to maintain and troubleshoot those instances for top performance. But now your boss has given you a new task: find out why the company reports are running so slowly and why the server itself seems unresponsive at times.

In this session we’ll talk about how to get the best performance from your SQL reporting server. We will discuss how to administer a SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS) instance; how to install and configure the service for best performance, how to see what reports are currently running, and find which reports are bogging down the server. 

This session will not cover report design scaling out, or SSRS for SharePoint.

      <title>Keeping the "Business" in Business Intelligence</title>
      <description>It is no accident the term “Business Intelligence” starts with “Business.” Any Business Intelligence initiative should, likewise, start with the needs of the Business. For many years, BI was seen as a technology project. This is one reason why so many BI initiatives fail. Rather than a Technology Project, BI is a Business Program. It must grow and evolve as the Business grows an evolves. 

In this session, we will discuss the following:
-- Why BI is a worthwhile investment (using case study examples)
-- What criteria to use in determining the success of a BI initiative
-- Several reasons why BI initiatives fail
-- Critical Success Factors for BI

So much of the success for BI happens before the requirements are even gathered. Come learn how you can set yourself up for success with Business Intelligence.</description>

      <title>Do More With Less: SQL Central Management Server and SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration</title>
      <description>Two of the of the most under-utilized management features of SQL Server are the Central Management Server and the SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration tools. The CMS is a powerful little tool creates a catalog of servers that allows you to execute any query or script against multiple servers at the same time. The SQL Agent Multi-Server Administration (MSX) tool allows you to create a SQL Agent job on one server and then deploy it to multiple servers instantly. When used in conjunction with each other, you have a powerful set of features that make managing your enterprise a lot simpler. 

SQL Server MVP Mike Hillwig will show you how to to deploy these two powerful features right out of the box without writing a single line of new code.

      <title>Power Query: Data Chemistry for the Masses</title>
      <description>ETL Developers have being doing chemistry with data for years in tools like SQL Server Integration Services. These tools require training, experience, and time that few business users have. But in the age of self-service BI, those business users need a way to shape data to support their analysis.

This session will show how Power Query can be easily used to take advantage of data's properties to drive the change we need to support our goals.

We will discuss/demonstrate:
-- The simple process of accessing a wide variety of data sources
-- The ease with which simple transformations can be achieved using the Power Query Ribbon
-- Power Query's fantastic ability to travel through time to see every step taken with the data
-- The foundations of the Power Query Formula Language, informally known as "M"
-- Using "M" to take Power Query WAY beyond what the Ribbon has to offer.

Come learn about what may well be the most exciting member of the Power BI family.

      <title>Pseudo-Constants in SQL</title>
      <description>You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>An Introduction To Resource Governor in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Do you have multiple databases with distinct workloads running on a single SQL Server Enterprise Edition instance? Have you ever had a runaway process or bad query from one system bring an entire instance to its knees, impacting a wide range of end users? If you answered yes to either of these questions, then come learn about Resource Governor for SQL Server. We’ll spend the first part of this introductory session going over the concepts you will need to know in order to implement Resource Governor successfully. Once we've covered the basics, we’ll spend the rest of the session working through a number of demos, reviewing exciting enhancements to Resource Governor in SQL Server 2014, and discussing scenarios in which you can use Resource Governor in your environment right away. Hardware resources are a valuable commodity.  Learn how you can control them effectively in a multitenant environment, ensuring they are assigned where they need to be.</description>

      <title>Twice in a Lifetime: T-SQL Refactoring 101</title>
      <description>Whether it's because you inherited the code from the "last guy," or your stored procedures haven't been looked at since the database was created in 2001, there will come a time when you need to rewrite old code. When you start this project you may ask yourself, how did I get here? And you may ask yourself, how do I work this? This is not my beautiful database. This is not my beautiful T-SQL. Letting the data go by, information flowing to the end users is the goal. Refactoring old code can be tedious, but necessary. Sometimes it isn't just about identifying the worst queries in your application, but figuring out how to rewrite everything to introduce the best practices that the last guy didn't know about five years ago. 

This session will cover ways to quickly find old T-SQL antipatterns, tools that can help make things easier to update code, and deprecated features that can't be used in modern versions of SQL Server. Don't leave your old T-SQL the same as it ever was.</description>

      <title>Every Byte Counts: Why Your Data Type Choices Matter</title>
      <description>Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns? Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why? Did you know that these data type choices can be a real performance killer? 

Attend this session to learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal. Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now! 

When you leave, you will be able to explain to your colleagues why data type choices matter, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.</description>

      <title>What's New in SQL Server 2014 OTHER THAN Hekaton?</title>
      <description>When asked about new features in the SQL Server 2014 Database Engine, people tend to only think of one thing: In-Memory OLTP, commonly known by its code-name "Hekaton." While In-Memory OLTP is a great improvement, many other features may prove more helpful for day-to-day database activity. This session will investigate the other new features offered in 2014, including delayed durability, buffer pool extension, enhancements to backups, partitioning, statistics, columnstore indexes, security, and much more!</description>

      <title>Building an Enterprise Data Repository with BIML</title>
      <description>Building out an Enterprise Data Warehouse can be extremely time consuming when developing the initial ETL building blocks.  Using a Data Repository and BIML to centralize enterprise data can decrease Data Warehouse development time.  It can be used as a central repository for ad-hoc reporting, and keep an audit trail of source system changes.  This session will look at the benefits of centralizing data in its original format and how to automate the collection and auditing using BIML.  </description>

      <title>Protecting Your Data with Encryption</title>
      <description>We’ve all seen the recent news stories about companies whose data has been stolen by hackers.  What was once a rare event has become all too common, and companies large and small are at risk.  While it isn’t always possible to prevent intrusions, you can reduce the risk by encrypting your data.  In this presentation, I’ll show you the four ways that SQL Server provides to encrypt data: hashes, cell-level encryption, database-level encryption (also known as transparent data encryption), and backup encryption.  We’ll also discuss the keys required for each type of encryption and discuss how to protect the keys themselves.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Data Modeling Primer</title>
      <description>Are you curious about Facts, Dimensions, and type 2 slowly changing dimensions that those Data Warehouse people talk about? This session will provide an introduction to the different architectures proposed by the two Data Warehouse proponents, Bill Inmon and Ralph Kimball.  We will present the theory and key concepts of Dimensional modeling and review why Dimensional modeling is important and the functionality a Data Warehouse can deliver that a normalized database cannot. We will also present some more advanced topics like heriarchies, snowflakes, recursive relationships, and bridge tables.

      <description>Issue a "SELECT {data} FROM {myTable}" statement and users need to trust the data returned is accurate. What happens when multiple processes access the same data? What happens further if one of those process is an UPDATE or even a DELETE statement? How about if both processes will be updating that data? Understanding Isolation in SQL Server is paramount in ensuring data integrity in your system. We will cover the different levels of isolation and how they impact what a user views when accessing the data at a given point-in-time.</description>
