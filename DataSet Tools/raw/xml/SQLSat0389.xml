      <description>Mickey Stuewe has been working with SQL Server since 6.5. That gives her over 20 years of experience. She has not only been a database developer, but also an application developer, even before Visual Studio existed. She is now thankful to be focusing on database design, t-SQL development, and query optimization. She also has a habit of enjoying SSIS and data warehouse design.

She blogs regularly on her website mickeystuewe.com and contributes to sites such as SQL Server Central and SQL Server Pro. She enjoys presenting at PASS Summit, SQL Saturdays, User Groups and other events.

When she is not immersed in SQL related activities, she enjoys action movies, art, reading, and laughing. She laughs loudly and often...just ask her children.</description>

      <title>(Near) Zero-Downtime Upgrades!</title>
      <description>SQL Server upgrades bring enticing new features and much needed enhancements, but can you perform them while maintaining high availability of your SQL Server infrastructure?  You can actually do this, by leveraging rolling upgrades, which are upgrades performed with minimal downtime or service disruptions.

In this session you will:

* Understand how rolling upgrades are better than in place upgrades
* Learn how to use database mirroring or AlwaysOn Availability Groups for rolling upgrades
* Explore how you might use Log Shipping to perform a simpler type of rolling upgrade

This is a demo-intensive session, so you can see rolling upgrades live and up close. If you are considering upgrading to a major version of SQL Server, or just applying a Service Pack or a Cumulative Update, this session is for you.</description>

      <description>In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.</description>

      <title>Interactive  Actionable Data Visualisation With Power View</title>
      <description>Historically, users have been constrained to consume data in fixed platforms, with one specific dimension for digital viewings and a couple of printed layouts. Nowadays, with the ubiquitous mobile devices available, Management expects to know key business indicators and day-to-day operation performance on the go. Using well-designed data models and visualization techniques, Power View can leverage timely and quick dashboards for analysis on the go.   
  
This session will discuss how to design the appropriate data model to enable self-service data exploration and insightful analysis in Power View, and how to create pixel perfect visualization for mobile devices. You will also learn how the techniques differ from traditional platforms. Using live demo, we will walk through ways to channel users focus on actionable analytics.  </description>

      <title>Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time</title>
      <description>One of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment is maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Additionally by default, SQL Server does not install with the best practices for every environment. You will learn best practices for system settings, file system layout and scheduling maintenance tasks. You will learn about what the best practices are for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both a physical and virtual world. You will learn about the tradeoffs and benefits to completely automating the build process. You were hear about lessons learned building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company. You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure consistency with your servers whether they are in the cloud, or on-premises.

      <title>10 Handy Tips On SQL Server Dates</title>
      <description>Are you working with an application supporting different time zones and international date formats? How does your choice of storing date / time values differ if you are using Windows Azure SQL Database instead of on-prem SQL Server database? Did you know that SQL Server Database Engine, Integration Services (SSIS) and Analysis Services (SSAS) all have slightly different date / time data types? How can you bullet proof your system for the ever growing data in your organization with much more date and time data to come?  
 
With time being the one thing that constantly changes, date and time calculations are widely used and essential to all business transactions. Yet, most systems only use one or two date data types; Is this a wise decision? Quite often data retrieval relating to a period of time does performs poorly, or worst of all, is not accurate. These 10 tips will help you bridge the gap, and provide the techniques to build bulletproof systems the users demand and DESERVE! </description>

      <title>Top 10 Admininistrator Mistakes on SQL Server</title>
      <description>SQL Server is easier to administrate than any other relational database on the market.  But “easier than everyone else” doesn’t mean it’s easy, nor does it mean is problem free. After all, many apps are growing from small, home-grown applications every year, with green IT professionals encountering issues that others had tackled and solved years ago.  Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don’t make the same mistakes over and over again. There is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier. Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you’ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.</description>

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</title>
      <description>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!</description>

      <title>Near Real-Time Data Warehouse Updates with CDC  SSIS</title>
      <description> If you need to keep a data warehouse up-to-date in near real-time, Change Data Capture (CDC) is a solution! If you are looking for a way to setup auditing of database changes, CDC is a solution! CDC has been around since SQL Server 2008, but has been underused because it was difficult to fully implement. SSIS 2012 now provides support for CDC with new components that make consuming the captured data very easy to apply. This session will define what CDC is and with live demos show how it is configured. Once it has been setup then you need to consume and apply those changes, this will be demonstrated with live demos using SSIS 2012 to create packages that apply the changes in a way that can be run quickly and keep your data warehouse up-to-date.</description>

      <title>Date Dimension: Past  Future in One Script</title>
      <description>All data warehouses need a date and time dimension to enable proper analysis across time. Most Data Warehouse designers will just use one provided by tools or create it in Excel, but what if you need to set up custom holidays or want different calendars, such as Fiscal or Julian? You can have any date and time dimension you need by using a single SQL script that can be modified and rerun as necessary. Learn what it takes to design a date and time dimension that does all of the calculations and formatting up-front so the reports can be easier to create. Sample script will be provided that creates the date and time dimensions and can be reused as often as necessary without breaking your data warehouse and it only take seconds to run!</description>

      <title>Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations</title>
      <description>With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.</description>

      <title>Simple things you can do to make  the Query Optimizer more efficient!</title>
      <description>On occasion as DBAs we have need to disable the foreign keys and constraints on one or more tables. Guess what, SQL Server no longer trusts those constraints when you re-enable them. What does that mean? In this discussion, we’ll talk about what the impact is to your queries when you have non-trusted constraints, how to find the non-trusted constraints, and how to soothe SQL Servers mistrusting heart so that it will trust your constraints again! How about your foreign keys? Are you using implicit conversions? Are your stats 'stale'? All of these things effect how the query optimizer works and can negatively affect you query performance. </description>

      <title>Thinking in SQL</title>
      <description>SQL is conceptually different than most programming languages. Join us for a conversation about SQL, why it's different from traditional procedural languages, and how to effectively use this truly elegant programming language. Rather than focus on the kinds of information easily located on the Web, we'll concentrate on how to use SQL for the tasks that it's really good at. Beginners will get a great introduction to the style of thought that gets the most out of SQL. Experienced developers will find a good refresher and an opportunity to share their experiences with others.</description>

      <title>Continuous Integration for Databases</title>
      <description>Building software is hard, and we often find that fixing bugs is expensive if they are not caught early. Continuous Integration has proven to be a valuable technique in improving software quality by finding problems quickly and letting developers know immediately they have introduced a bug.This session demonstrates how you can implement CI for SQL Server databases, execute automated tests against your code and inform developers that they have caused a problem immediately. </description>

      <title>Tools in Your Toolbox You’re Not using!  Why Not?</title>
      <description>Policy Based Management (PBM) and Central Management Server (CMS) are tools you already have if you have at least one SQL 2008 instance. These powerful but often overlooked tools are simple to use, and together they give you a central point from which to manage all your SQL instances. You can even manage your SQL 2000 and 2005 servers as well. This live demo session will show you how easy it is to use these 'hidden gems' that have been lying about in your SSMS toolbox. Real world solutions for real world problems in just minutes.</description>

      <description>Merge replication – Some people hate it and some people love it.  
    Merge replication can be used to provide an autonomous (writable) copy of a database.  It is easy to set up and is very failure-resilient.  It can be used as a database high-availability method.
    I will explain why I am a lover of merge replication.  I will demonstrate merge replication set up, explain conflict resolution, and tell stories from my experience to illustrate its resilience.

      <title>Introduction to Wait Types and Response Time Analysis</title>
      <description>Using Response Time Analysis and Wait Types is a newer method for tuning SQL Server instances. As a result, there is often confusion on exactly what the data means. The issue typically centers around the fact the wait time data is analyzed at the wrong level or the collected wait time data is not detailed enough. This presentation will focus on these problems and review several real-life case studies of using SQL Server Wait Type data coupled with Response time performance analysis to solve the most difficult performance related issues. </description>

      <title>Treating Tables Like Legos, Partitioning Basics</title>
      <description>Partitioning allows us to isolate parts of our table as small chunks called partitions.  In turn, these partitions allow us to do some really cool tricks for manageability and performance.  In this session we'll look at the concepts surrounding partitioning and how we can apply them.  We'll reinforce what we cover with some cool demo's showing some really neat tricks.</description>

      <title>Stored Procedures vs. Ad-Hoc SQL: Performance Showdown!</title>
      <description>Still not sure of which is faster? Let us put this matter to rest once and for all. We will measure every single aspect of the execution of a stored procedure vs. its Ad-Hoc query counterpart, and only one will prevail! We will look at raw performance, memory consumption, plan cache usage, and network bandwidth utilization. We will also discuss options for environments on which the code cannot be modified.
