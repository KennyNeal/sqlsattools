      <title>Building an Effective Data Warehouse Architecture</title>
      <description>You’re a DBA, and your boss asks you to determine if a data warehouse would help the company. So many questions pop into your head: Why use a data warehouse? What’s the best methodology to use when creating a data warehouse? Should I use a normalized or dimensional approach? What’s the difference between the Kimball and Inmon methodologies? Does the new Tabular Model change things? What’s the difference between a data warehouse and a data mart? Is there any hardware that is optimized for a data warehouse? Join this session for the answers to all these questions. You’ll leave with information that will amaze your boss and lead to a big raise… – or at least lead you down the correct path to adding business value to your organization!</description>

      <title>Absolute Introductory Session on SQL Server 2014 In-Memory Optimized Databases (Hekaton)</title>
      <description>Hekaton is Microsoft’s code word for their new OLTP in-memory, optimized data processing option for frequently-used tables in SQL Server 2014. In certain instances, Hekaton can yield performance gains of over 10x. This session will cover the benefits of Hekaton, why developers and DBAs would want to use Hekaton, and the different options for creating Hekaton tables. We’ll also look at the native-code stored procedure optimizations when using Hekaton. Additionally, this session will show the range and limitations of Hekaton and how it differs from traditional SQL Server tables (such as transaction handling). Along the way, the session will have several code demonstrations where we’ll look at performance benchmarks. If you’ve heard about Hekaton and in-memory optimizations and terms such as ‘latch and lock free structures’ and wondered what it all means, this session is for you!</description>

      <title>Automating Your SSIS Design Pattern for Faster Development</title>
      <description>Once you finish designing the SSIS packages needed for your project, the process of creating those packages is mostly redundant and time-consuming. As the source or target systems go through changes (even as small as a column rename), you’re forced to modify the packages.

BI Markup Language (BIML), which is a free plugin, removes the pain-points involved in manual development by programmatically generating packages. In this session, you’ll learn the basics of BIML and see how you can use it along with metadata to create packages automatically. You’ll also see how easy it is to regenerate the packages when the system changes. You’ll leave the session with knowledge of BIML’s building blocks and a principle I call “D[ee]MOB” that helps you automate SSIS development in your environment.</description>

      <title>Table Vars  Temp Tables - What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represent temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>Version control with GIT for the DBA</title>
      <description>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed a version control system (VCS) called git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Well. whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We will cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Vis</description>

      <title>Performance Tuning - Analyzing Execution Plans</title>
      <description>Did you ever get woken up at night from a call from a user screaming about poor query performance, but didn’t really know how to begin attack the problem?  In this session, we will explore the basics of execution plan analysis and how to single out issues that pertain to base table operations.
In this presentation, we will identify what indexes are being used by the SQL Optimizer, the different type of index operations that are performed by SQL Server and which operations are generally considered the preferred method of data retrieval. We will discuss how to determine if the indexes used by the Optimizer are optimal, according to best practices, and the exceptions to those cases.   Finally, we will cover the relationships between different types of index operations and joins within SQL Server, including how the SQL Optimizer determines which join type it will use, along with the pros and cons of each join operation

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <title>From Zero to Loading a Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>You're tasked to create the ETL process for a brand-new data warehouse. Where do you start? Data warehouse ETL boils down to three specific problems: Staging, Dimensions, and Facts. This session will show you solutions to these three problems. You'll first learn the fundamentals of a data warehouse before diving into creating packages and leveraging common patterns. You'll see both simple and advanced scenarios such as incrementally loading staging tables, processing type1 and type2 slowly changing dimensions, early arriving facts, snapshot fact tables, and bridge tables. If you want to create scalable and efficient SSIS packages to load a data warehouse, this session is for you.</description>

      <title>APPLY Yourself</title>
      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>

      <title>Punishing Yourself with Continuous Delivery</title>
      <description>Do you deploy code once every couple of months, or quarters…. or years?  Is deployment terrifying and fraught with catastrophes?  Then why not do it more often?  Continuous Delivery (CD) takes deployment to the next level, turning the terror of pushing out code into happiness, sunshine and butterflies.  CD is the practice of maintaining the deployment pipeline so that new features can be delivered quickly and with fewer failures.  This session will cover how to do CD in a Business Intelligence Environment.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Cryptology - A Primer</title>
      <description>So, you got told you need to encrypt "the database". Now what?
Join this session by security expert Sebastian Meine (Ph.D.) for an introduction to the fascinating world of cryptology. In this session, geared towards the DBA, you will learn the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, discover what a cryptographic one-way hash function is and probe into cryptographically secure pseudo random number generation. After exploring the different definitions, you will be able to observe how to implement encryption, decryption, transparent data encryption (TDE) and hashing in SQL Server. We will pay special attention to areas where the choice of encryption technology affects your database maintenance and recovery strategies. After attending the session, you will be able to identify the right technology to use in your specific use case and you will have the basic knowledge to start implementing it immediately.

      <title>The Ticking Timebombs in Your Databases</title>
      <description>You've worked hard to build the best systems you can, and then one night you get called in to resolve a production incident.  As you peer into your database, you see it: something so bad it sends shivers down your spine.  How did that get in there?  Who did that? Why? And how do you fix it?

In this session, we look at the workarounds, technical debt and clever designs that can cause you grief when you least expect it.  We will also include perfectly fine features that can haunt you later. We will discuss how these things happen and give you tools to identify the ones that cause the most pain.

Join us: you'll keep your job, have happier users and get more rest.

      <title>Storage For the DBA</title>
      <description>One of the biggest issues in database performance centers around storage.  It’s also one of the hardest places to troubleshoot performance issues because storage engineers and database administrators often do not speak the same language.  In this session, we’ll be looking at storage from both the database and storage perspectives.   We’ll be digging into LUNs, HBAs, the fabric, as well as RAID Groups.  In addition to theory, we’ll be looking at an actual EMC SAN so that we can translate what we see in the Storage Array with what we see on the actual server.</description>

      <description>Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used.  Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head.  Contemporary IT environments should standardize their architecture including a tier of flash.   Virtualized or non-virtualized, standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, efficiency (technical and cost), reliability,  availability.  Learn how flash flips the /faster bit  the significant impact flash makes not just in terms of performance, but also best practices,  the massive savings in licensing driven by consolidation on flash.</description>

      <title>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</title>
      <description>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

      <title>DBA 911 - Database Corruption</title>
      <description>Database corruption is simply a fact of a DBA's life - if you haven't seen it yet, you will. Success or failure depends on having a solid plan to deal with different types of corruption. In this session, we will discuss usage of related DBCC commands such as DBINFO, CHECKDB and PAGE. You'll learn how to monitor for corruption with SQL Server Agent Alerts and Jobs, and when it's time to restore instead of repair. After attending this session, you will be able to check for issues such as page corruption or data purity problems, and take the appropriate measures to deal with them.</description>

      <title>Automate Your ETL Infrastructure with SSIS and PowerShell</title>
      <description>Much of your ETL process flow consists of packages that are very similar in structure, capturing data from a single source and transferring that to a single destination. Creating the individual packages can be tedious and it's easy to miss something in the process of generating the same basic package over and again. BI Markup Language makes it easy to build new packages, and PowerShell makes creating the BIML scripts easy. In this session we'll show you how to use PowerShell to generate dozens of SSIS packages doing similar tasks from a defined set of ETL sources.

      <title>Optimizing Protected Indexes</title>
      <description>As a SQL Server DBA I see my role having 2 main focuses. First is to protect the data and second is to ensure performance is maximized. More often than not companies forget about data security when they focus on performance tuning. In this presentation I will mention a few cases where encryption could have saved a lot of hassle. I will then demo a method that can be used to "index" commonly searched on encrypted values (ex: SSNs, Credit Card, etc) helping reduce the impact on the performance of a query.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of installing, configuring and patching Microsoft SQL Server? Azure SQL database maybe a way to move some of your existing infrastructure to the cloud. 

Depending upon your companies philosophy, it might be great for development, testing, and possibly production environments.

The exciting thing about this service is that new features will be released on this platform first before trickling down to the on-premise editions.

The demonstration will show how to create and load a new database from scratch using the Azure Portal, SSMS and BCP.

But in the last few years, NoSQL technologies ("it's schemaless!"), cloud ("our databases are managed elsewhere!") and recent SQL Server features ("it's new and improved!") will have an impact on DBA jobs, tasks and careers.#160; 

Our panel of SQL Server experts will share their #160;current experiences in the data profession.#160; They will share what they believe you should be working towards now and in the future.

      <title>Maximizing Failure with Continuous Integration</title>
      <description>Continuous Integration (CI) is an Agile methodology which enables teams to quickly find bugs in their code and fix them before they reach production.  The goal of CI is to always have a working product that can be deployed at any time.  Through its practice, developers fail faster and more often than ever before, allowing the developer to fix problems while they are fresh in the mind.  This session will cover the basics of CI and show how this can be implemented in a Business Intelligence environment.  </description>

      <title>Become a SQL Server Performance Detective</title>
      <description>When your database is having performance issues, you need to quickly and accurately diagnose and resolve performance issues.  Like any good detective, you need to look for clues to find “The Smoking Gun.”  We will cover various tools at our disposal which can help us pinpoint and resolve issues quickly, using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs), SQL Profiler and other queries.   We will discuss emergent performance issues as well as chronic issues and find ways to piece together the clues to figure out the root cause of our problems.</description>
