      <title>Increase your SSIS productivity with Biml</title>
      <description>Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML language for Microsoft Business Intelligence that can take your Integration Services package development to the next level. Creating template packages added productivity to your Integration Services development effort. If the template design changes after development begins, a fair amount of rework to packages could be needed. See how Biml can help create template packages that can better adapt to changing business needs and allow for more comprehensive design or redesign. 

This session will be a demo based session that will inspire you to make Biml your number one integration services development tool. Learn how to use Biml scripts to create staging tables and integration services packages. Add metadata to your Biml scripts and really watch the possibilities expand.

      <title>Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel</title>
      <description>Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.</description>

      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson introduces Microsoft Business Intelligence 2012 and the Business Intelligence Semantic Model ("BISM").  He then overviews the Tabular model, beginning with the creation of a project with SQL Server Data Tools (“SSDT”), and continuing from the data import steps to the creation and management of calculations, measures and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).  Finally, he provides insight to the creation and maintenance of perspectives and hierarchies, as well as other considerations involved in working with Tabular.</description>

      <title>WIT Panel</title>
      <description>The definition of confidence is “belief in oneself and one’s powers or abilities” but the authors of the new book “The Confidence Code” define confidence as “the quality that turns thoughts into actions.” Traditionally men have been found to have much more confidence in themselves than do women. For example, in a study at Hewlett-Packard, men applied for a promotion when they thought they could meet 60% of the qualifications while women applied only when they thought they could meet 100%.   Attend this WIT session to learn more about confidence and how it impacts your career and life. To prepare for the session, it is recommended that you complete The Confidence Quiz (http://theconfidencecode.com/confidence-quiz/) </description>

      <title>An Introduction To Resource Governor in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Do you have multiple databases with distinct workloads running on a single SQL Server Enterprise Edition instance? Have you ever had a runaway process or bad query from one system bring an entire instance to its knees, impacting a wide range of end users? If you answered yes to either of these questions, then come learn about Resource Governor for SQL Server. We’ll spend the first part of this introductory session going over the concepts you will need to know in order to implement Resource Governor successfully. Once we've covered the basics, we’ll spend the rest of the session working through a number of demos, reviewing exciting enhancements to Resource Governor in SQL Server 2014, and discussing scenarios in which you can use Resource Governor in your environment right away. Hardware resources are a valuable commodity.  Learn how you can control them effectively in a multitenant environment, ensuring they are assigned where they need to be.</description>

      <title>Power to the Prototypes: Using Power BI to Deliver Better SQL Reporting</title>
      <description>As SQL Server professionals, we have a complicated relationship with Excel-based tools. Rather than broadly paint Excel as friend or foe, why not learn how Power Query  Power Pivot can improve the SQL Server solutions you develop? In this session, we’ll cover scenarios where Power Query and Power Pivot can be leveraged to get the most from the proof-of-concept phase of your reporting, ETL,  analytics projects. Learn how Power Query can help you test the quality of your data well before the production ETL is deployed. We’ll also cover how Power Pivot can help you visualize the structure and granularity of your data, and why it’s the perfect “gateway drug” for SSAS cube development. If you've ever had a BI project fall flat because “We didn't know what we didn't know” or want to avoid delivering a hundred reports when the data merits ten, this is the session for you!</description>

      <description>Ever encounter a table consisting only of BIGINT, CHAR(255), and NVARCHAR(MAX) columns? Did your gut tell you that this is bad, but you had difficulty explaining why? Did you know that these data type choices can be a real performance killer? 

Attend this session to learn how database records are stored within SQL Server, and why all data types are not created equal. Armed with that knowledge, we will then explore several performance scenarios that may be impacting your systems right now! 

When you leave, you will be able to explain to your colleagues why data type choices matter, assess your own systems, and implement some best practices to mitigate these performance killers.</description>

      <title>Extending Your Availability Group for Disaster Recovery</title>
      <description>Did you know that SQL Server Availability Groups can be a great solution for disaster recovery?  Availability groups have become well known for their high availability capabilities, and for good reason: they work well, they remove some of clustering’s limitations, and they are fairly straightforward to setup.  Extending an availability group to multiple sites for disaster recovery becomes more complicated.  A lot of moving parts have to come together for it to work properly - SQL Server, Windows, Active Directory, and DNS all get involved in this advanced configuration.  In this session, we’ll discuss some of the factors that complicate a multi-site availability group deployment, and we’ll walk through a multi-site deployment so you can see how it’s done.</description>

      <title>Right-Sizing Your SQL Server Virtual Machine</title>
      <description>Virtualizing your top-tier production SQL Servers is not as easy as P2V’ing it. Sometimes allocating more resources to the VM is the wrong approach, and getting it wrong will silently hurt performance. What is the most effective method for determining the ‘right’ amount of resources to allocate? What happens if the workload changes a month from now?

The methods for understanding the performance of your mission-critical SQL Servers gathered over the past ten years of SQL Server virtualization will be addressed, and valuable processes for performance statistic collection and analysis will be displayed. Come learn how to properly ‘right-size’ the resources allocated to a VM, improve the performance of your SQL Servers, and keep it maximized well into the future.</description>

      <title>Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>SQL Server Compression and what it can do for You</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2008 has introduced Table compression to the DBA toolkit. We all know there are different kinds of compression available in SQL Server. What some may not know is the subtleties of compression. Such subtleties include that not all Page Compressed tables are entirely page compressed. This session will show you how to reach into the database and discover compression states at the page level. At the lower level, this session will also show how to determine compression settings of objects in the database. Participants will be able to use undocumented commands as well as commands such as PIVOT to derive some interesting information from the database engine.</description>

      <title>Introduction to PowerShell for the DBA</title>
      <description>One goal of a DBA is to automate gathering information such as the specifications of all of your SQL Servers. In this session we will show you the basics of the PowerShell language. Then we will move on to how you can use PowerShell to go through a list of servers and grab information like the processor specs, check if the machine is a virtual image, memory size, SQL version, etc. and produce a formatted Excel file with the information. </description>

      <title>Data Discovery with Power Query for Excel</title>
      <description>Power Query, a free add-in for Excel 2010 and 2013, will enhance the self-service business intelligence offering from Microsoft. With Power Query the business analysis along with the BI developer can combine and shape data from a wide variety of data sources in a quick and easy manner. This task can enable more time to be spent in analysis and discover and less time build ETL plumbing. 

This session will demo the ease of the data extraction process in Power Query. We will explore multiple data sources and even modify the language to create a foundation for further exploration into Power Query.

      <title>Strategies for SQL Server Index Analysis</title>
      <description>Properly managing indexes for a database is a common usse in many environments. When reviewing an index, should it have a single or multiple columns? Should the table be a heap, a clustered index or clustered columnstore index? These considerations are often at the forefront when analyzing your indexes. In this session, we'll look at easy methods for identifying new indexes, we'll review patterns for index consolidation, and discuss how and when to remove indexes. At the end, you'll have a strategy that helps design indexes to improve performance.</description>
