      <title>SQL Server Performance Tuning. Practical Guide.</title>
      <description>Nothing is perfect, which means that your database may be not perfect as well. And one day you may decide that your database is slow and it's time to optimize it. But.. Where to start? When to end? What to look at? Which queries are slow? How to identify the real bottleneck? And so on, and so on. There are a lot of questions that should be answered in process of performance tuning. And in this session, we will find answers to all these questions going from collecting data for analysis, through identifying bottlenecks to optimization of the particular queries. On this way we will learn practical techniques of performance tuning and solve bunch of issues. All this will be done using tools, which are installed on your system by default. Minimum of theory and a lot of practice.</description>

      <title>Azure Big Data Solution â automation of deployment</title>
      <description>By now youâve probably heard about Big Data 1.000 times or more so why a new session about big data you might ask.
Show how to make creation and deletion of AZURE elements automatically as part of your ETL process or by Powershell, automate the trivial procedures and work on the interesting parts
 This session will show you how :
â¢ Downloads and prepares several years of demo data and storing it in a dedicated Azure Blob Storage account.
â¢ Create a storage account and container for the HDInsight Cluster.
â¢ Create a SQL database server instance and a SQL database for the Hive Metastore. We will also setup the necessary firewall rules so that you can access the server directly.
â¢ The HDInsight cluster is provisioned and configured for access to the sample data.
â¢ A partitioned Hive table is created over top of the sample data 
â¢ Exploration of the result
â¢ And how to automate these task either in Powershell or SSIS.

      <title>Dive into the Query Optimizer-Undocumented Insight</title>
      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>Taking your application to memory</title>
      <description>Based on our work with converting an existing application to memory optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures this session, will take you through this journey and show you the (large) gaps between what we have in our normal SQL belt and what is possible in Natively compiled stored procedures. I will show how to overcome all the gaps and get all out normal stuff to work in these monster fast procedures â even the things that the documentation says cannot be done.

You will therefore be taken through the concept of in-memory tables and what to be aware of when considering converting your database tables and code to In-Memory tables and through a life migration demo be given all the tips and tricks I picked up while doing so. After attending this session, you will be able to leverage on the new concepts and work your way around its current limitations to gain enormous speed increase and a lock-free environment.</description>

      <title>Understanding SharePoint reporting options for SQL Server</title>
      <description>The SharePoint landscape has changed dramatically over the last few years, and this session is designed to help Business Decision Makers, IT Managers and SQL Professionals understand what it offers as reporting platform.  Exploring the different options, benefits and considerations for using SharePoint to report on data in SQL Server.  Explaining that there are important decisions to make about which platform to use, and whether cloud based services should be considered.  It will show a number of SharePoint options including Business Connectivity Services, Reporting Services, Excel Services and Power BI.  It will consider the differences in functionality and configuration for different versions of SharePoint and SQL.  Including comparing the platforms of SharePoint Server, SharePoint Foundation and Office 365.  Finally it will challenge attendees to think about the purpose of the solution being delivered, who it is for and the long term strategy.

      <title>SSRS Inception: Reporting on Reporting services.</title>
      <description>Still using Reporting Services? Yeah me too! Does this scenario sound familiar? You already have a large SSRS environment but the users still want more reports. You create a new, all singing, all dancing dashboard that removes the need for a bunch of reports, awesome. You launch it and explain to the business  that you are deprecating the old reports. "WAIT! We still need that for Jill in HR to do her end-of-month", or "We might still need that" - these types of comments are what leads to having a load of reports that are not being used.  
 
Wouldn't it be great if you could see who is viewing a report, in what format and how often, all inside your current SSRS environment? With this data wouldn't it then be even better if we could automate a process to email the owner of that report to say "HA! I told you no one looked at this report!". In this session we will look at how we can do all of this and more by mining the SSRS DB. </description>

      <title>Visualizing streaming data in real time</title>
      <description>We're all familiar with reports or dashboards that show you a static snapshot of the data
that has to be refreshed on an interval. And those are very important visualizations.
But sometimes you just have to have a real time view of your data streams and snapshots aren't enough.
What if you could monitor multiple servers with SQL Trace or Extended Events or had some other source of streaming data and 
be able to see it all happening live on a central monitoring website?
This is a scenario we'll take a detailed look at and build a system for such monitoring.
We'll do this by using Extended Events .Net provider to get the live data stream, 
SignalR to get the live stream from the server to the website and the D3 javaScript library 
for actual real time visualizations on any device.
After seeing all this in action, you'll definitely get a few ideas on where you could use this in your company.</description>

In this session we will walk through the configuration of a complete on-premises BI platform with SharePoint. We will configure different scenarios, and the technologies necessary for building the infrastructure. After this session you will be able to setup the applications and all the supporting services to make SharePoint a successful and performant BI platform. From Excel services to Kerberos delegation.

      <title>Testing T-SQL Code with tSQLt</title>
      <description>Unit-Test are a mature tool in traditional programming languages like C# and meanwhile accepted as de-facto standard. Using Stored Procedures and Functions you can put much programming logic right into the database. This logic has to be tested too. SQL Server Data Tools from Microsoft are one possible approach to generate unit tests for T-SQL Code. One of the disadvantages of SSDT is that the tests are implemented as C# or VB Solutions outside of the database. An alternative to these approach is using tSQLt, a Testing-Framework that is written entirely in T-SQL and is run completely in the database. So you are able to write unit tests in SQL Server Management Studio. In his talk SQL Server MVP Frank Geisler will show how the tSQLt Framework is set up and how it works and how you can write Unit Tests for different SQL Server Objects. Besides the free Version of tSQLt you can buy SQL Test from Redgate which is a very useful GUI for tSQLt and is demonstrated as well.</description>

      <title>Creating Dynamic Packages</title>
      <description>In a perfect world an ETL solution would only have to import data from a single file that always had the same name deliver it to a single already existing table.  Unfortunately this case is the exception rather than the rule.  How can you use SSIS to: 
1.    Iterate through all files in a folder and import their content into SQL
2.    Dynamically create and name table based on a data source 
3.    Dynamically create a T-SQL statement at runtime based on run time conditions
This session focuses on how to create SSIS packages that can change to meet runtime events dynamically based on the environment.
Each attendee will leave with the knowledge and toolset necessary to:
1.      Use expressions within SSIS packages
2.      Use variables to dynamically create SQL statements
3.      Configure custom dynamic logging
4.      Use package configurations and parameters and environments to make packages more portable at execution
5. 	Replace dynamic SQL using expressions in SSIS</description>

      <title>SQL Anti-Patterns</title>
      <description>[ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
You can learn the basics of SQL in three days but itâll take you 10 years to become good at it.

In this full training day we will take a look at a range of common design and coding mistakes to get an idea of the patterns and practices that absolutely do not work well for optimum performance, scale and design.

Anti-patterns are a way of naming these common design mistakes in order to make them easier to identify and remember (and correct!). Sooner or later as the demands on your database performance increase, so will the need to identify and resolve your anti-patterns.

During the day we will grow acquainted with anti-patterns on a physical level, a logical level, a SQL Query and application level, and spice it them up with some seriously foolish errors made by both myself, my colleagues and the industry at large!

      <title>Automating business processes with SharePoint, Office 365 and Azu</title>
      <description>[ To book this and any of the other pre-conference sessions please visit http://sqlcambs.org.uk/preconall/ ]
Many people are forced to use Microsoft#174; SharePoint#174; because it is already there or part of the Office 365â¢ ecosystem; therefore many users see it just as another task to add to their burgeoning  workload of tasks they have to complete in their busy working day. When any technology is introduced into a business it should help not hinder users. It should enable users to do more, not less. Technology should meet business needs and not be focused around a single product.

With this in mind, Penny will look at automating business processes using out-of-the-box functionality of SharePoint and with the use of Azureâ¢ Logic Apps outside SharePoint, beyond firewalls and beyond even your own datacentre. You can create these workflows using no-code visual designers.

You will learn:
â¢To identify the different error handling methods in control flow, data flow, and script tasks 
â¢Be able to utilize event handlers to proactively handle errors 
â¢Be able to redirect data error and proactively handle data flow errors 
â¢Be able to identify error descriptions and log error details

      <title>Microsoft â Building a Data Driven Strategy</title>

IDC research, commissioned by Microsoft, shows that better outcomes from data and analytics projects correlate with greater competitiveness of an organization in its industry or a better ability to fulfil its mission in the public sector. Although correlation does not equate to causation, a growing body of research shows financial and productivity benefits directly linked to better data-driven decision making enabled by business analytics solutions.

Four characteristics distinguish leaders in analyticsâthe use of more diverse data types and sources beyond social media to include the Internet of Things (IoT), adoption of more diverse analytical and self-service tools, methods, and metrics suited to broad range of users from data scientists to business analysts and executives, distribution of insights to a more diverse audience of business users, and the right-time application of most timely data.</description>

That means, that leaving the pre-con, you will never ever again have to go over hundreds of packages to change a datatype or add a column, all youâll need to do, is to change your meta-data and you are home free.

As our meta-data repository, we will use SQL Servers built-in Master Data Services. You will be given a thorough introduction to this component and learn how to use and administer it.
Besides getting a working knowledge of BIML AND MDS, and become able to use that in your ETL development, you will also get an overview of, and get to work with, the following advanced ETL concepts:

      <title>Using SharePoint as a Service Delivery Platform</title>
      <description>Large organisations usually have their own dedicated Service Delivery IT platform for tracking and managing "Service Requests", but what happens in smaller organisations?
Without the right management tools and software, tracking and delivering service request resolutions can be a resource intensive task in itself and does not bode well for the quality of service to the end-user.

If your organisation has a SharePoint deployment, it doesn't have to be this way.

In this session we will utilise SharePoint's Out-Of-The-Box functionality and through a selection of customisations and technical know how, we will lay the foundations so that you may implement your own Service Delivery platform and enable your organisation to provide the type of efficient service delivery your end users expect.</description>

      <title>SharePoint - Migrating Databases and Farm Configuration using PowerShell</title>
      <description>The session will first cover how to go about transferring SQL Databases between SharePoint Farms using PowerShell. Including common scenarios, approaches and potential gotchas, as well as some example scripts.


It will then move on to cover the often manual task of replicating Service Application Configurations between SharePoint Farms and demonstrate how this can also be simplified and automated with the use of PowerShell.

      <title>Understanding  Solving Columnstore Problems</title>
      <description>Dive deep into Columnstore Indexes and discover their advantages and some of the limitations.
Look into some of the Columnstore Indexes myths, understand more complex concepts of Batch Mode  Query Processing with another depth.

Can you make your Columnstore queries ran even faster ? 
Can you actually lower the Degree of Parallelism and get a better performance ?
How much memory does Columnstore Index actually use when working with queries ?
How can you test your Columnstore queries in Row Mode and what is the actual difference between Row  Batch Modes.

The answers on those questions are to be revealed at this session.</description>

This full-day seminar will show you how to optimize SQL Server queries and create high-performance applications. You will learn about the inner workings of the query processor so you can write better queries and provide the query processor with the quality information it needs to produce efficient execution plans. Youâll also get tips for troubleshooting under-performing queries. In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton), a key new feature of SQL Server 2014, will be covered as well. Topics include:

How the query optimizer works
Troubleshoot queries using extended events, SQL trace, dynamic management views (DMVs), the data collector, and other tools
Work with query operators for data access, joins, aggregations, parallelism, and updates
Speed up queries and dramatically improve application performance by creating the right indexes

      <title>Quick Start Guide to JavaScript Frameworks for SharePoint Apps</title>
      <description>Learn about JavaScript frameworks and new developer practices in SharePoint and on Office 365. JavaScript frameworks are there for you to help you develop faster and easier. You don't need to do your apps from scratch.
Apps and the cloud app model have brought not only new ways to interact, send, write, and receive data from SharePoint. Apps have also brought JavaScript frameworks into SharePoint development. JavaScript frameworks are right there as part of the app template when you start a SharePoint hosted or a Cloud app. In this session, I'll show what you can do with JavaScript frameworks that are part of the app template. I'll show jQuery, Bootstrap, and modernizr. </description>

      <title>No stress with OSTRESS, Lessons Learned from a high traffic Replay attempt</title>
      <description>One of my client engagements lately was about replaying a workload. The system had so many batches per second that I couldn't actually do a replay but had to run in stress mode and try to slow down the replay in such a way that it resembled the production system.

I'll show you how to do that amongst a bunch of other things that I learned and would love to share with you.
If you are thinking about using OSTRESS / RML Utilities to analyse your system and stress test it on a different machine to find bottlenecks, then this session is for you. </description>

      <title>Building abstract layers for data protection and business logic</title>
      <description>Many developers are working with direct access to the data layer of a database (tables) by ORM or .NET, Access, ... This access methode maybe a good choice for small applications which use a dedicated database where no security or business requirement is needed.

This session demonstrates the protection of data by using schemata for data protection and implementation of business logic for multiple applications. I will demonstrate the usage of schemata in an application life cycle to reuse codes for reporting in the same way as for the web application or the fat client application.</description>

      <title>Efficient Indexing Strategies</title>
      <description>Indexes are incredibly powerful objects to optimize your database performance. However, when not implemented optimally, indexes can also have a negative impact on your queries! In this session we will take a close look at the different index types, how they work and how we can use that knowledge to design an efficient indexing strategy for your databases. We will also spend time analyzing existing indexes. Are those indexes being used? Can we combine indexes? Those are some of the questions you will learn to answer in this session.</description>
