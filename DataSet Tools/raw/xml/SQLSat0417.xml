      <title>Inside Transactional Replication</title>
      <description>You can probably do a good job in configuring and maintaining transactional replication in your environment. You can get these things done with reasonable quality without knowing how SQL Server does things under the covers. However if you want to take your skills to the next level and troubleshoot complex replication issues, it's crucial to know how transactional replication works internally.

This session will answers questions like; How does the log reader know where to start the scan? How does it add the commands to the Distribution database? How many threads are involved in a replication process? How does distribution agent look for pending transactions to distribute to its subscribers? Knowing all these will help you to manage and troubleshoot the replication very effectively. Come lets learn together!</description>

      <title>Performance in 60 Seconds - SQL Tricks Everybody MUST Know</title>
      <description>Data and Database are very important aspects of application development for businesses. Developers often come across situations where they face a slow server response, even though their hardware specifications are above par. This session is for all the Developers who want their server to perform at blazing fast speed, but want to invest very little time to make it happen. We will go over various database tricks which require absolutely no time to master and require practically no SQL coding at all. After attending this session, Developers will only need 60 seconds to improve performance of their database server in their implementation. We will have a quiz during the session to keep the conversation alive. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session. </description>

      <title>Indexes – The Unsung Hero</title>
      <description>Slow Running Queries  are the most common problem that developers face while working with SQL Server. While it is easy to blame the SQL Server for unsatisfactory performance, however the issue often persists with the way queries have been written, and how Indexes has been set up. The session will focus on the ways of identifying problems that slow down SQL Server, and Indexing tricks to fix them. Developers will walk out with scripts and knowledge that can be applied to their servers, immediately post the session.</description>

      <title>Telling Stories with Data</title>
      <description>Data is all around us; it is in bits and pieces; it is in shapeless chunks. These data can tell us stories. Organizations have loads of these data lying around, but seldom make use of it. Modern data analytics methods however, give us a plethora of methods to access this data, mash them up and tell stories using them. Stories, that can help make effective decisions.

This session looks at how you could collect data from the various sources in your organization, combine them, process them and tell stories using the wealth of tools given to us by Microsoft. Words you would hear are business intelligence, self-service data analytics and big data.</description>
