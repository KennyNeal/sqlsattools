      <title>Data mining Algorithms in SQL Server, Excel, R, and Azure ML Part 2</title>
      <description>Data mining as the most advanced data analysis technique is gaining popularity. With modern data mining engines, products and packages, like SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), Azure ML, and R, data mining has become a black box. It is possible to use data mining without knowing how it works. However, not knowing how the algorithms work might lead to many problems, including using the wrong algorithm for a task, misinterpretation of the results, and more. This session is the second of the two sessions that explain how the most popular data mining algorithms work, when to use which algorithm, and advantages and drawbacks of each algorithm as well. Demonstrations show the algorithms usage in different products.</description>

      <title>Benefits of analytics using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning </title>
      <description>Data mining on-premises has a long tradition with Microsoft SQL Server and Machine learning in Azure is the cloud based brother, both supporting a hand-full of great algorithms for  your business to grow.
This session will be focused on benefits of building a predictive model using Azure Machine Learning (ML) studio and exploring its capabilities. We will cover from 1) Quick introduction to ML to 2) creating ML workspace with data upload, 3) training the data-set and evaluating the solutions/models and 4) using this solutions with ML API Service.  With a great support to R language in Azure ML, we will also explore the usage of R script in Azure ML.

      <description>SQL Server 2014 comes with dozens of new improvements in various areas. Some of the performance features introduced with the 2014 release did not get the needed attention for some reason, though. In this session we will see five new ways to make our applications dramatically faster. And no, neither of these is Hekaton tables nor clustered columnstore indexes. </description>

      <description>The prevailing opinion is that the optimizations for SQL Server are usually only done on the server itself. But is there anything we can do on the client to gain more speed? In this session aimed at .Net and SQL developers, we'll dive into the workings of the .Net SqlClient and give you insight into way more than just SqlCommand.ExecuteReader() and SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery().</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Indexing with Automated Execution Plan Analysis</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2005 made much of information necessary for performance available through easily accessible DMVs. Ad-hoc performance tuning is possible simply with direct queries to the DMVs. Many database today actually show signs of having too many indexes. A degree of index consolidation is possible by visual examination. A more ambitious objective is to build a set of good  indexes with no more indexes than necessary. To do this, it is necessary to catalog the index usage of hundreds if not thousands of SQL statements. Impossible or impractical? This can be done by automating execution plan analysis using ExecStats (free on QDPMA.com)</description>

      <description>Its quite easy to find business cases where IoT, Stream Analytics, Machine Learning and PowerBI are used as standalone technology or in a synergy. As biologist I am using “Microsoft glasses” to look, understand, and change ecosystems around me. By using this technologies I will show you that their purpose is not just to make your business better but to make the Earth a better place to live.

      <title>Azure SQL Database Tips and Tricks for Beginners</title>
      <description>Microsoft released SQL Azure more than three years ago - that's enough time for testing. So, are you ready to move your data to the Cloud? If you’re considering a business (i.e. a production environment) in the Cloud, you need to think about methods for backing up your data, a backup plan for your data and, eventually (sic!) restoring data. In this session, you’ll see the differences, functionalies, restrictions, and opportunities in SQL Azure and On-Premise SQL Server 2008/2008 R2/2012/2014. We’ll consider topics such as how to be prepared for backup and restore, and which parts of a cloud environment are most important: keys, triggers, indexes, prices, security, service level agreements, etc.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014 Memory-optimized Data Exchange</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2014 introduces Extreme Transaction Processing, a brand new memory-optimized data management feature, targetting OLTP workloads. In this session you will learn about two new, and not very well known, features that you can use to share sets of data between modules - either within the database, or between client applications and databases:
- Memory-optimized Table Variables; and
- Memory-optimized Table-valued Parameters.</description>
