      <title>SQL Server  Power BI Geographic and Temporal Predictions</title>
      <description>Data science, predictive analytics, insights, statistics… There are so many buzzwords around these days. These words are frequently used in an introduction to some technical article, at the beginning of a presentation, and even in regular talk. However, when it comes down to a real analysis, you typically get reports with very nice Power BI graphs, but without real forecasting. It is up to you to recognize the patterns and then probably make some kind of interpolation by yourself. Data mining is the part that is based on statistics and can really make forecasts automatically. Data mining is part of SSAS installed in multidimensional mode. Is it possible to get the best from both words? This advanced session explains the forecasting algorithms and shows how you can integrate geographic and temporal predictions in Power View and Power Map visualizations and interactive animations. Popular buzzwords finally get some real meat behind them.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Azure DocumentDB</title>
      <description>Azure DocumentDB is a new highly-scalable NoSQL database platform on Microsoft Azure, designed as a fully managed cloud service for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, DocumentDB supports schema-free designs, and scales across replicas with fast write performance and eventual consistency. But DocumentDB also offers several unique features that make it a compelling candidate for NoSQL scenarios, which you will learn about in this session. The platform is based on HTTP/REST, embraces JSON as a standard document format, and is supported by a wide range of SDKs for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, and Node.js. Without defining any index paths, new documents are queryable within milliseconds, using SQL grammar or LINQ. Learn these and other capabilities, including server-side JavaScript-based stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, tunable consistency, and more.</description>

      <title>Debugging SQL Server</title>
      <description>When you were young, did you enjoy taking things apart to look at their inner workings? If you did, or still do, this session might be just the thing for you! Combining SQL Server internals with our curiosity on how things work, we will take a look underneath the hood of SQL Server by debugging it.

In this session we will debug the various parts of SQL Server using WinDbg. I’ll show you how to setup, configure and use WinDbg to extract information from a running SQL Server process. We will take a look at the various dump files that record information when a SQL Server crash occurs, capturing valuable information on why SQL Server crashed. And finally, I will demonstrate how you can use Extended Events to create dump files when specific conditions occur, helping you learn more about why they occur.

Don't worry if you are not a programmer. We will go through this session at a relaxed pace without causing (too many) headaches!

      <title>Now Where Did THAT Estimate Come From? - Part 1</title>
      <description>NB: This is part one of a two-part session
The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there?
In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are built and maintained and how they are used to estimate row counts. But you will also learn how filters and joins influence those estimates.
Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries.</description>

      <title>The dangerous beauty of Bookmark Lookups</title>
      <description>You know Bookmark Lookups in SQL Server? You like their flexibility to retrieve data? If yes, you have to know that you are dealing with the most dangerous concept in SQL Server! Bookmark Lookups can lead to massive performance losses that blows up your CPU and I/O resources! Join me in this session to get a basic understanding of Bookmark Lookups, and how they are used by SQL Server. After laying out the foundation we will talk in more details about the various performance problems they can introduce. After attending this session you have a better understanding of Bookmark Lookup and you are finally able to tell if a specific Bookmark Lookup is a good or bad one.</description>

      <title>Desigining Complex Tabular Models - A Case Study</title>
      <description>While building of Tabular Models may be straight forward it rapidly becomes more complex when you steer off-piste and into more complex design pattern such as:
- Many to Many relationships
- Semi-Additive Measures
- Last Ever Non Empty
- Events in Progress
- Versioned Fact Tables
- Almost real time processing requirements
- Huge volume
- Non Star Schema Data Warehouses
- measure explosion and lack of calculated dimensions
- Selecting Hardware

This one hour session will walk through an actual case study of a tabular model and discuss the pain points we encountered on the way, along with solutions and workarounds.

      <title>Performance Troubleshooting Using DMVs</title>
      <description>Performance troubleshooting is a complex subject with many factors under consideration when you find poorly performing SQL statements, using proven methodologies, and evaluating performance data available in the Dynamic Management Views and Functions. In this session, we’ll go over a foundation of how and which DMVs to use to identify those problematic statements for versions of SQL Server from 2005 – 2014.

We’ll be demonstrating using practical examples, including code that can be taken away and used on attendees’ own SQL Servers. We’ll also discuss how to identify common causes of performance issues, and learn how to quickly review and understand the wealth of performance data available</description>

      <title>Flying Through the Clouds--Performance Tuning in Azure</title>
      <description>So between your management and Microsoft, it’s been decided that you are moving your SQL Server workloads to the cloud. Whether it’s Microsoft Azure SQL Database or running SQL Server in a VM, there are unique performance tuning challenges that are different in a cloud environment. Just like when you moved your SQL Servers from physical to virtual environments, you will learn new techniques for tuning workloads. In this session you will learn about:

•	Optimizing TempDB in an Azure VM
•	Reducing latency between application VMs and database VMs
•	Right sizing Azure VMs for performance and cost
•	Striping I/O across devices in Azure VMs
•	Performance Tuning in Azure DB

You will learn about techniques that will not just improve your system performance, but save you company money, which can be easily quantified just in time for your performance review.

      <title>Big Data for the SQL Ninja</title>
      <description>As more enterprises start implementing big data solutions, how does the DBA support these efforts and do they have the skills and knowledge to integrate big data solutions into your current architecture and processes? This demo-filled session has two purposes; first, to help DBAs understand how to apply their existing SQL Server skills in understanding and utilizing HDInsight and related technologies. Big data technologies don’t need to be intimidating, and this session will help DBAs see how they can easily apply their current skill when working with big data. Second, this session will show how SQL Server and HDInsight be used together to create solutions to solve big data problems without the complexities of massive learning curves and using technologies DBAs are already familiar with. We’ll look at technologies that make working with big data much less daunting, including HiveQL and Sqoop, both of which don’t require a rocket science degree to use.</description>

      <description>In this session, we'll explore some of the things you should be looking at within your virtual environment to ensure that you are getting the best possible performance out of it. 

We will discuss how to look for CPU performance issues at the host level. We will also be looking at the Memory Balloon drivers and what they actually do, as well as how you should be configuring them and why.  

We will then talk about some of the memory sharing technologies which are built into vSphere and Hyper-V and how they relate to SQL Server, and we’ll finish up the session with some storage configuration options.

      <title>Moving away from SQL Profiler to use Extended Events</title>
      <description>This session will guide you with practical tips  tricks to move away from SQL Profiler and use Extended Events instead.
Extended Events were first introduced in SQL Server 2008 and should be used instead of the SQL Profiler. Still lots of DBA's and DEV's use SQL Profiler nowadays because of the convenience and lack of an Extended Events GUI in SQL 2008. 
Extended events however impose a minimal performance penalty on SQL Server and provides much more detailed tracing.</description>

Querying the data is also much easier than it was before with the workarounds that we had to use. In this hour you will understand the concept, learn how to create temporal tables and how to query them, and what the pros and cons are.

      <title>Dive into NoSQL with Azure</title>
      <description>Are you curious about the array of NoSQL technologies available in Azure, but aren't sure how they differ from each other or the relational models available? Or maybe you've got specific data in mind, but aren't sure which NoSQL technology is best for your application. 

Microsoft Azure supports a variety of NoSQL technologies (i.e. key/value, document, column and graph databases). In this session we walk through the options, explaining what each one provides. </description>

      <title>Taming the Beast – How a SQL DBA can keep Kerberos under control</title>
      <description>The word Kerberos can strike fear into a SQL DBA as well as many Windows Server Administrators. 
What should be a straight forward and simple process can lead to all sorts of issues and trying to resolve them can turn into a nightmare.
This talk looks at the principle of Kerberos, how it applies to SQL Server and what we need to do ensure it works

      <title>Boost your analytical superpowers with spatial data</title>
      <description>Analyzing huge sets of data isn't something humans are made for. Humans are more suitable for making decisions based on things they can see. So how do you bring that into the business? One of the options you have is to visualize some of your (location based) data on maps. A feature for this in SQL Server is called spatial data (geo data). By using physical locations and shapes to visualize data, you can quickly analyze big sets of data.

In this session, we're going to take a look at how spatial data works, how you can query it, and how to use it to leverage your decision making process.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2014 Memory-optimized Data Exchange</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2014 introduces Extreme Transaction Processing, a brand new memory-optimized data management feature, targetting OLTP workloads. In this session you will learn about two new, and not very well known, features that you can use to share sets of data between modules - either within the database, or between client applications and databases:
- Memory-optimized Table Variables; and
- Memory-optimized Table-valued Parameters.</description>

      <title>Monitoring SQL Server, Key performance metrics and how to interpret them</title>
      <description>SQL Server has many moving parts with a massive amount of metrics that you can monitor to see how your system is performing, but which ones do you need to pay attention to, what do they mean and how do you interpret them? In this session we will look at the key areas of CPU, Memory and Storage, from performance counters to DMVs that you can use to check on the health of your server and gain insight into how it is performing. We will also look at some of the configuration options that exist which you can use to ensure that you have a healthy base on which to build.</description>
