      <title>Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel</title>
      <description>Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.</description>

      <title>Revenge: The SQL! - Director's Cut</title>
      <description>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</description>

      <description>The Analysis Services 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM) unifies Multidimensional (OLAP) and Tabular (relational) options for organizational BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson introduces Microsoft Business Intelligence 2012 and the Business Intelligence Semantic Model ("BISM").  He then overviews the Tabular model, beginning with the creation of a project with SQL Server Data Tools (“SSDT”), and continuing from the data import steps to the creation and management of calculations, measures and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).  Finally, he provides insight to the creation and maintenance of perspectives and hierarchies, as well as other considerations involved in working with Tabular.</description>

      <description>What’s this thing called PowerShell? Why should I care? And what can it do for me? During this beginner level session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will be covering all of those questions and many more that are all too common among PowerShell noobs such as: How do I figure out what the commands are? And how do I extend PowerShell’s functionality to manage products like SQL Server? This session is designed for those people who haven’t yet embraced PowerShell and want to know how to get started. The first beta of PowerShell was released 10 years ago and with it now being part of Microsoft’s common engineering criteria, it’s not going away any time soon so what are you waiting for?</description>

      <title>PS C:\gt; Get-Started -With 'PowerShell Desired State Configuration</title>
      <description>In this day and age, with the virtualization of servers causing systems in your datacenter to multiply faster than rabbits on Viagra, how do you perform configuration management on all of those systems and the software that they run while operating on a shoestring budget? How do you detect and remediate configuration drift to stay in compliance with your organization’s standards? During this session, PowerShell MVP and scripting games winner Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how DSC (Desired State Configuration) can be used to perform configuration management of your systems. DSC is a new management platform in PowerShell which was introduced with WMF 4.0 that allows for the declarative configuration of systems. Prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Power BI Desktop</title>
      <description>Most of us are overwhelmed with data from all the different applications that we use on a daily basis.  Bringing all the data together is often a very time-consuming and sometimes a challenging process.  Even further, attempting to analyze and visualize the data poses new challenges that is sometime difficult or impossible to overcome.  Now with Power BI this can all be made very simple.  Individuals, ranging from novice information workers to advanced IT professionals can quickly and easily transform, analyze and visualize data using a single tool, Power BI Desktop.   In this course we will work through four main topics: Shaping Data, Building a Data Model, Visualizing Data and Using the Power BI Server.</description>

      <title>Analytics and the DBA – Using BI Power tools to visualize your SQL Infrastructure</title>
      <description>DBAs do not always have time to work with some of the amazing visual data tools that are becoming common place now for analysts.  In this presentation I will show how in just a few very easy steps you can learn more than the basics of PowerView, PowerPivot and Data Mining using data you are already familiar with as a DBA, your SQL Server installation data. We will look at new and interesting way to load, transform, merge and analyze configuration and performance data for many servers simultaneously. I will also demonstrate how to best utilize that data for reports in Excel, SSRS and Visio to get the most out of automation, standardization and visualization with the new Power tools.</description>

      <title>Continuous Integration with SQL Server Data Tools</title>
      <description>After a long maturation process, SQL Server Data Tools is emerging as a huge step forward in database development.  It won't be long before Visual Studio replaces SSMS as the primary IDE for SQL Server developers.  One of the greatest benefits of making the switch is the continuous integration capabilities that are now streamlined by the tool set.  In this session we will discuss how SSDT works, the goal of continuous integration, and how you can put them together to dramatically improve your productivity as a database developer.</description>

      <title>How Queries Work</title>
      <description>If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language. Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply? In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.</description>

      <title>Windowing Functions with SQL Server 2016 (Preview)</title>
      <description>Windowing functions are powerful analytic functions built into SQL Server.  SQL Server 2005 introduced the core window ranking functions, and SQL Server 2012 added time and statistical percentage windowing functions.   These functions allow for advanced variable creation, and are of direct benefit to people creating features for data science.  This talk will also recommend further reading on this topic.</description>

You're a new DBA, you want to be a DBA, or you've been declared an "Accidental DBA" and the phone rings. Someone tells you that they believe SQL Server is having a performance issue, what now?  The application is running slowly. Can you help them? Do you even know where to begin to help them?  In this session we'll cover how to handle performance tuning from the very beginning, when the user says "The database is slow."</description>

      <title>Introducing the SSAS Tabular Data Model</title>
      <description>New to SQL Server Analysis Services 2012 is the Tabular model. In this session you'll learn about the newest way to do analytics in SQL Server. We'll compare and contrast it with the traditional Multidimensional Model, then see how to create your first "cube" using the Tabular mode. Finally we'll look at some of the reporting options for using your new Tabular database, including SSRS, Excel, and PowerView. </description>

      <title>Zero to Hero with PowerShell</title>
      <description>There are two kinds of people in the SQL Server world. Those who are using PowerShell, and those that will be. In this session you'll learn how to become one of the "cool kids" using PowerShell.

In this session we'll start with the basics, like cmdlets, variables, and the IDE. But we'll quickly transition to more advanced topics like flow control, functions, and creating  your own objects. By the time you are done you'll have a good grasp on how to implement your own solutions in PowerShell. </description>

      <title>So you think MDX is hard?</title>
      <description>A lot of people have this perception that MDX is difficult. It really isn't, when you understand what it is trying to accomplish under the hood. In this session we'll begin with a fundamental understanding of what MDX will do for you. Then we'll roll up our sleeves and dive into MDX code, starting from the simplest select statement and winding up building calculations you can put into your own SSAS Cubes.
