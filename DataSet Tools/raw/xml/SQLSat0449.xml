      <description>Mickey Stuewe has been working with SQL Server since 6.5. That gives her over 20 years of experience. She has not only been a database developer, but also an application developer, even before Visual Studio existed. She is now thankful to be focusing on database design, t-SQL development, and query optimization. She also has a habit of enjoying SSIS and data warehouse design.

She blogs regularly on her website mickeystuewe.com and contributes to sites such as SQL Server Central and SQL Server Pro. She enjoys presenting at PASS Summit, SQL Saturdays, User Groups and other events.

When she is not immersed in SQL related activities, she enjoys action movies, art, reading, and laughing. She laughs loudly and often...just ask her children.</description>

      <title>Building Perfect SQL Servers, Every Time</title>
      <description>One of the biggest challenges in any large SQL environment is maintaining consistent configurations and meeting the pressures from the business for rapid server deployments. Additionally by default, SQL Server does not install with the best practices for every environment. You will learn best practices for system settings, file system layout and scheduling maintenance tasks. You will learn about what the best practices are for most SQL Server configurations, and how to automate your SQL Server builds in both a physical and virtual world. You will learn about the tradeoffs and benefits to completely automating the build process. You were hear about lessons learned building a private cloud at a Fortune 100 telecommunications company. You will also learn how use these same methods to ensure consistency with your servers whether they are in the cloud, or on-premises.

      <title>The Database: The Elephant in the ALM Room</title>
      <description>Many teams and individuals are still building their databases and maintaining them through old-fashioned manual processes. This, even as these same teams move towards an automated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) through the adoption of DevOps best practices. These manual processes are hurting the ability of your database deployments to keep up with modern development. Is there a technical reason for this slow adoption of ALM best practices in the database world, or is there a cultural problem preventing a reassessment of these manual processes? Or, could it be both? This session will address these questions as it explores the challenges presented by ALM for databases. We will discuss the necessary first steps required to move from a manual database deployment process to a fully automated one. You will learn about tooling that can assist you in implementing these new processes. Your database deployments can take advantage of the same processes you use for application deployments.</description>

      <title>A Masters Passport to Extended Events</title>
      <description>As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

      <title>Designing Stored Procedure Solutions</title>
      <description>With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

      <title>Data Modeling for Integration of RDBMS with NOSQL</title>
      <description>Join us to explore how emerging data modeling methods and model notations help us define, and easily communicate, robust integration points between NOSQL data stores and emerging RDBMS 'Lean Data Warehouse' models that would otherwise be challenging to map across due to radical differences in normalization.   Did you buy the pitch about how 'BigData and RDBMS  Data Warehouses can remain in isolation'.      Me neither!      You will leave this sessions not only free from some rigid E/R modeling assumptions and diagramming standards, but also armed with an introduction to a practical method of logical data modeling in the new world of polyglot data storage.</description>

      <title>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</title>
      <description>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.
Here you’ll learn:
•	The most useful regular expression commands.
•	The appropriate times to use regular expressions.
•	How to use regular expressions to write code for you.
•	How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

You might want to just stick your head in the sand and ignore it, but as database professionals it is always good to know about what other technologies might be out there to compliment your existing solutions.  We will not be going deep into any one solution, but by the end of this session, the goal will be that you understand the following:

1. The different types of NoSQL databases
2. Some use cases where they might be applicable
3. Some of the major solutions out there for each one</description>

      <title>Silent Killers Lurking in Your Database Design</title>
      <description>A good database design goes deeper than the rules that Codd gave us. We need to leverage SQL Server to help enforce these rules. In this class we’ll look at some common questions like: I have foreign keys, why do I need foreign key constraints too? Why are smart keys not so smart? If I use an identity field, do I still need to declare it as a primary key? The wrong answers to these questions can slow your queries down over time and even create bad data. Join me in my session as we look at demos to understand how silent killers can begin to lurk in your database.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

      <description>Columnstore indexes were introduced in SQL Server 2012, along with a new type of query processing "batch mode". In SQL 2014 they get even better--we can use a Columnstore index as a clustered index and update it. In this session we will explore the basics and beyond of Columnstore indexes and how they can help your warehouse performance. We will also examine their impact to insert and update performance, and the best use cases for implementation.</description>

      <title>Code Sins</title>
      <description>It’s impossible to follow every best practice all the time. “Code sins” are those things we do to our code that are either so horrendous that they can’t be borne, or that have such tremendous consequences that your stored procedures wish they’d never been created. Attendees will hear about the most common code sins that make code difficult to read, support, run and extend, and practical strategies for reversing the trend.</description>

      <title>Overview of Open-Source Tools of the Hortonworks Data Platform</title>
      <description>I will present an overview of the open-source tools of the Hortonworks Data Platform for Hadoop applications development. In particular, we will examine (1) Sqoop for moving data between relational databases and Hadoop, (2) Pig as a platform for complex data transformations and (3) Hive as a tool for data analysis that allows writing ad-hoc SQL-like queries against large datasets.</description>

      <title>Extended Events - Better than Profiler</title>
      <description>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008. With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature. Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events. We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration. We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events. This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun. Attendees will be able to take back several sample XE sessions to help troubleshoot different issues and get to more intimately know their data/environment.</description>

      <title>Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL</title>
      <description>Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn about formatting T-SQL for readability and why top down design is not the best solution for writing T-SQL. You’ll learn why implicit conversions slow queries down and how to leverage simple techniques for minimizing the performance impact of explicit conversions. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.</description>

      <title>Physical Join Operators</title>
      <description>SQL Server implements three different physical operators to perform joins. In this session we will examine how each of these operators work, its advantages and challenges. We will try to understand the logic behind the optimizer's decisions on which operator to use for various joins using (semi) real life examples and we will see how to avoid common join related pitfalls.</description>
