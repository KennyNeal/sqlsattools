      <description>I am a father of 4, and live in Raleigh North Carolina. I love fixing problems, and learning new technologies that can help me fix those problems faster and better than I did the time before.

In my spare time I like to read, speak, and learn new things. I currently work as a Database Administrator at ChannelAdvisor where I solve fairly interesting problems on fairly large databases.

You can often find me on Twitter where I talk about SQL, beer, and anything else I find interesting.</description>

      <title>Getting the Skinny on Minimally Logged Operations</title>
      <description>Any changes to Non-Memory Optimized tables require a certain amount of logging to the transaction log in order to ensure the integrity of the operation and of course the database. Most of these are fully logged operations and can write a tremendous amount of data to the transaction log. As you probably already know these can lead to various performance and availability issues. However you may be able to minimize the effect of these with what is called a minimally logged operation. This session will outline how these can be used under the right conditions to save time, resources and potentially a lot of headaches. Various demos will hit home on just how much of an impact this can have on some every day operations.</description>

      <title>Scripting out SQL Server for Documentation and Disaster Recovery</title>
      <description>Most DBAs need to use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects.
Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exportable and live at the server level, above the database.
Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for moving or recovering a SQL server instance for Disaster Recovery purposes.
Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, and Server Triggers</description>

      <title>Introducing Forensic Analytics with PowerPivot for Excel</title>
      <description>Despite the wealth of analytical technologies available today, 65% of fraud at public companies is detected through tips, management review, or simple accidents.  Forensic Analytics combine human intuition and leading-edge technologies, and can provide superior detection methods to significantly improve the detection and investigation of illegal or unethical activities.
In this session, we explore Forensic Analytics: a set of techniques we can use to uncover irregularities in financial data. We also gain an understanding of goals of Forensic Analytics: to enable us to find out how — and why — these irregularities exist, and to find out their source(s) — especially when fraudulent activity is suspected.  We discuss guiding principles that are key to isolating data anomalies, and outline a standard, repeatable process to Forensic Analytics. Throughout the session, we view examples of how we can employ PowerPivot for Excel to drive Forensic Analytics via various tests and reviews.  </description>

      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data...With Constraints!</title>
      <description>Never given time or care, never forming good relationships, becoming bloated, corrupt and rife with indistinguishable copies, and all so horrifyingly pervasive in society. But enough about the Kardashians, what about YOUR DATA? If you want to straighten it out and prevent it from going too far in the first place, this session is for you. We will cover constraint basics (not null, check, primary key/unique, foreign keys), provide standard use cases, and address misconceptions about constraint use and performance. We will also look at triggers and application logic and why these are NOT substitutes for (but can effectively complement) good constraint usage. Attendees will enjoy learning how to keep THEIR data off the tabloid page!</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Execution Plans</title>
      <description>Are you just breaking into the query tuning side of managing your SQL Servers?  In this session, we will cover the basics you need to start leveraging execution plans as part of your tuning process.  We will discuss how SQL Server creates and uses plans, and how to collect them.  Once we have the plans, we will go step-by-step through how to read them, and what the most common operators mean.  We will look at the different types of operators not just from a standpoint of what they do, but how they can impact query performance.  We will also cover how good database design and maintenance allow you to get better execution plans through having the right indexes and up-to-date statistics.

      <title>From T4 to BimlScript</title>
      <description>This session is for database and application developers who know Microsoft's T4  (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) from Visual Studio but would like to make the transition to the powerful BimlScript language for generating SSIS and SSAS projects dynamically. Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) and BimlScript let you tap into the rich metadata of your SQL Server databases, multiplying your efficiency and accuracy many times over. During this highly-interactive session, we'll leverage your familiarity with template-based code generators like T4, comparing its features to BimlScript to tackle some difficult Business Intelligence tasks in a fraction of the time it would normally take. If you don't know T4, any prior experience with template-based code generators will prepare you well for this session. Moreover, if you've never done dynamic code generation before, you may still find this session fascinating and a quite useful addition to your toolbox.</description>

      <title>What's in a Date? Avoiding confusion with Dates, Times, and Durations</title>
      <description>Dates and Times can be very confusing. Julian Days, Fiscal Years  Months, UTC, Atomic Time, Leap Seconds, ISO 8601, and more clutter up what, on the surface, appears to be a simple set of data types. This session will work to demystify dates and times, with a focus on SQL Server. It will cover the pros and cons of each of SQL Server's date/time data types, why you need a Calendar table in almost every database (and maybe a Time table too),  various good methods of handling intervals and durations, how to use the IANA tzdata database to help with time zones  daylight savings. As a bonus, if we have time, we'll also talk about SQL Server 2016's Temporal tables and what they mean for the current/history table pattern.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with SSIS Script Tasks and Components</title>
      <description>SSIS has many great built-in tasks and components. Sometime, though, you need to go further than what they allow. Come to this session for an introduction to the scripting capabilities of SSIS. 
Many data movement activities can be handled with SSIS using the built-in tasks and components. Eventually, though, you will run into a scenario that will be better handled by extending SSIS functionality with custom code. In this session, we will cover the basics of using scripts in SSIS control flows and data flows. We’ll talk about the pros and cons of scripts, review the development environment for scripts, cover some interesting and useful .NET classes, and walk through multiple examples of scripts that add useful functionality to SSIS.</description>

      <title>SQL Server and Azure</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2014\2016 is on the edge of one of the larger revolutions in Database technologies in the recent past. The reason is that we have a new technology out there, and your may have heard of it, it’s called the cloud. Microsoft's version of cloud technologies is called Azure.

In this session, we will learn some details of using SQL Server 2014 with Azure, as well as Azure Database as a Service. In addition, we’ll explore some of the new, improved features available in SQL Server 2016. We’ll explore how SQL Server integrates with Azure, and how you can put one toe in the water and get started integrating the cloud into your organization.</description>

      <title>Managing a Production Azure SQL Database - True Story!</title>
      <description>I develop for and manage a small, but active, web application that lives completely inside of Azure from code to data. I've been involved with it since inception, and I've learned a few things about developing for, and managing data in this environment the hard way.

I'd like to share some of the lessons I've learned in hopes that it can save others some time.</description>

      <title>Scalable Application Design with Service Broker</title>
      <description>How your business applications interact directly with the corporate database can dramatically affect how successful you are. One of the biggest issues is performance with large databases. By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates, you can focus performance concerns  where the timeliness is critical. SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently and minimizes conflicts with your critical updates. This session walks you through the steps to get Service Broker running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.</description>
