      <title>#09 | DBA life made easier with SQL Server 2016 - Query Store and</title>
      <description>DBA always faces challenges in troubleshooting live performance issues. In SQL Server 2016, the two new features introduced to help a DBA to be more productive. The Query Store is a feature that will help in visualizing what is happening with your executing queries, which otherwise is hard to collect with DMVs. The UI rich interface makes it easier to troubleshoot live scenarios as well has collect data for troubleshooting. Have you ever felt a need to see the execution plan when executing a query while troubleshooting? Live Query Statistics helps you view the live execution plan rather than waiting till end of the execution of query to see the actual execution plan. This session is recommended for advanced users as you will need basic understanding of troubleshooting using execution plans. </description>

      <title>#22 | The DBA with his Head in the Clouds</title>
      <description>With Azure data centres located round the globe, will your company be looking more at cloud options? The Azure VM approach doesn't change your day to day role much, but Azure SQL Database certainly does. 

In this session we will compare the core features of Azure SQL Database against SQL Server in an Azure VM, including the limitations and how to create, access and configure it.  We'll then compare scaling-up and scaling-out and the change in perspective that a DBA needs to manage a mixed environment.   Finally, we'll look at some of the DBA activities that are still needed on Azure SQL Database and how these can be achieved easily.</description>

      <description>Although Availability Groups are relatively easy to implement, there are many complexities when it comes to administering and optimizing them--especially if you are familiar with Failover Clustering. In some cases, your existing database solutions perform slower. In this session, we examine the various potential problems you can have when implementing Availability Groups and the potential solutions to these problems. This session covers areas such as performance, administration, and security management. You learn how to manage complex jobs, backup strategies, and logins within an Availability Group environment. You also learn how Availability Groups might dramatically affect your application performance, how to recognise such performance problems, and how to resolve them. With a number of real-world examples, this practical session enables you to maximize the benefits of Availability Groups.</description>

      <title>#05 | Automated Test Driven Development with SQL Server using nUnit</title>
      <description>Testing software is hard work. Testing BI solutions is even harder;there's lots of moving parts, the tools are thin and it takes a lot of time and effort. Software development uses unit testing and while this can be applied to the different parts of a BI solution, most people are more interested in the numbers the solution produces and proving that they are right. So can you validate the numbers in your BI solution? And can you do it quickly and easily? In this session we will cover an approach for automating the validation of your BI solution covering multiple scenarios with a hand full of demos. We will be using nUnit as a framework and some free codeplex tools, so we can run a suite of tests every time we load data into our BI platform. This is not continuous integration, and it is not unit testing in the true sense either. It is, instead, "continuous validation", and it can provide you with an awful lot of assurance for not very much extra effort.</description>

      <title>#06 | Big Data Fundamentals with Azure HDInsight</title>
      <description>Big Data is a phrase used to describe large, possibly complex datasets. With today's data explosion of devices and sensors, technology is responding with new ways to practically and economically store and process the resulting Big Data.

This session describes the fundamentals of Big Data and Hadoop, leading to the introduction of Microsoft’s cloud-based Big Data service: Azure HDInsight. The session includes numerous demonstrations to show how files can be archived in the Azure Blob Store and then efficiently processed with a cluster of servers. The demonstrations will introduce Hive, a query language designed to ensure that Big Data remains approachable to database developers, and the integration of Big Data into a conventional Business Intelligence (BI) solution.

This session will be of interest to those new to the concept of Big Data and interested to understand the challenges that it is designed to solve.</description>

      <title>#14 | Introduction to Biml  BimlScript</title>
      <description>Within every Data Warehouse project there is always ETL development that is very repetitive in nature, for example, you need to import 20 different flat file exports from the ERP system, you need to load 15 dimensions into the data warehouse and so on.
With Microsoft SSIS out-of-the-box, you are forced to create multiple individual packages which is very time consuming due to the lack of easy code reuse. In a typical BI project, the ETL implementation can easily take up 60% of the project time, so it is beneficial if the development time of similar SSIS packages can be cut down.
Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is an XML dialect for defining Business Intelligence assets across the Microsoft SQL Server platform
In this session Craig will introduce you to Biml  BimlScript, providing those new to Biml with a foundational understanding of what BIML is and what the benefits of using Biml are.

      <description>How do you optimize a DAX expression? This session will introduce you to the useful tools to measure performance, gathering data to find the bottlenecks and helping you in writing new optimized versions of DAX. Starting from SQL Profiler, you will learn which events are relevant for DAX, and how to collect them in different environments (Analysis Services, Power Pivot, Power BI). We will show DAX Studio, which simplify and speed-up the data collection process, and makes it easy to find bottlenecks in storage engine and formula engine. VertiPaq Analyzer and other small tools will be also used to collect other useful information. The goal of the session is to provide you a methodology to analyze performance of your DAX measures, to find the bottleneck and to identify the main reason of a performance issue.</description>

      <description>Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</description>

      <description> Tempdb is an integral part of SQL Server, and is often overlooked when trying to get the most out of your system. 

In this session we will go over what tempdb is used for, why it is a special type of database and how to use it to tune the performance of your overall system.

We will start with determining the best configuration, number of database files to use and the common performance issues that tempdb can indicate. We will then use these best practices to optimise our instance and performance tune our queries to make your system faster.
