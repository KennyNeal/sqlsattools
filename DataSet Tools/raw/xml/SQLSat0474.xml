      <description>Brandon Preece started from the early days of SQL Server. His first migration was from SQL Server 6.5 to SQL Server 7.0. Since that day, he has loved being a Database Administrator working with every major version since then. He now manages the best SQL Server Team you will ever find (maybe he is a little biased). He love teaching technology and helping others find the best way to use this incredible tool that we all love called SQL Server.

I work with SQL Server during the day and have been for many years. I enjoy teaching and making a difference.

In my free time, I like action sports. I enjoy snowboarding and Mountain Biking. I started doing triathlons in 2015 and am liking the challenge.

      <title>The need for Speed : SMO Internals for High Performance Automation</title>
      <description>Ever wonder how Management Studio gets information for the Properties dialogs it shows?  SQL Server SMO consists of objects that can be used to manipulate SQL Server and the objects it contains. Ever wanted to get information about a database without opening Management Studio, or writing a query against DMVs? Ever wanted to change a property of a database without writing an ALTER DATABASE statement? This session will cover a few main objects in SMO and how to manipulate them using SMO as well as learning a Turbo button for your automation using SMO. Join us for a great time while we take a look behind the curtain and seeing how SMO really works. The session will have a majority of demos to give us time to really see how things work and how you can control things to get just what you want as fast as you can.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Master Data Services</title>
      <description>The “Gold” record.  The “master maintainable list”.  

There is so much data in so many systems that businesses may have no way of telling which record is accurate and up to date.  Even if a given record is accurate, how do we correct the inaccurate records in other systems?  The dissonance between these systems costs businesses time and money and can lead to poor customer relations.

Master Data Services (MDS) provides tools to get all of your databases singing from the same sheet of music.  This hour will include an overview of key master data management concepts, an introduction to MDS and how that fits in a data quality strategy and demonstrations integrating MDS systems using SSIS.

      <description>Developers have been using Visual Studio for years to create apps that connect to your database. Why not use Visual Studio to create your database and help you keep it running fast and lean? Come learn how to use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) in Visual Studio to create tables, views, stored procedures, users and more. These database objects can be tied together during development which means no more procedure calls to misspelled tables, no more inconsistent column names and no more orphaned objects. We will also cover how easy it is to publish changes to different environments. Come join us and find out how you can add Visual Studio to your tool belt and help bring joy to your database development lifecycle process.</description>

      <title>Flash and SQL Server—Re-Visiting Best Practices</title>
      <description>Flash storage is a game changer for virtually every app in which it is used.  Whether used locally, for tiered storage, or all-flash arrays, flash is turning what we thought we knew about SQL Server best practices on its head.  Contemporary IT environments should standardize their architecture including a tier of flash.  Virtualized or non-virtualized, standardizing on in-server flash is vital for optimizing performance, scalability, efficiency (technical and cost), reliability,  availability.  Learn how flash flips the /faster bit  the significant impact flash makes not just in terms of performance, but also best practices,  the massive savings in licensing driven by consolidation on flash.</description>

      <title>Why should I care about the plan cache?</title>
      <description>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this first (and hopefully not last) installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series a case for why working knowledge of how to query the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments, followed by a review of relevant DMV's for the newly motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBA is sometimes so moody.</description>

      <description>After spending the last decade or so completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I spent the last year supporting the SQL Server instance for a team of Java developers. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. I did find, however, that there were cultural differences which made my biggest challenges different from what I was used to dealing with in the .Net world. Come hear about my misadventures with JBoss, server side cursors, and NOCOUNT settings.</description>

      <title>Power BI Intro for DBAs Using  Indexing Strategy Analysis as a Data Source</title>
      <description>Like Frankenstein's Monster (or our teenagers) things get released into the wild and behave differently than planned - database usage patterns are no different.  Join Tim as he reviews what to look for when tweaking your index strategy: poor clustering key decisions, underutilized indexes, covering indexes gone wrong, overlooked heaps and fill factor failures are just a few of the blunders to be identified.  

Pointing out what is sub-par is only part of the process though.  As a group we will discuss what the better options are based upon what we uncover.  In a combination of instructor-led training and group discussion formats we will use Dynamic Management Objects, System Catalog Views and even Ola Hallengren's SQL Server Maintenance Solution to identify improvement points and next steps.  

Tim then goes one step further and introduces you to how Power BI takes this collected metadata to the next level of performance analysis.</description>

      <description>How to keep the database parts of three tier server environments (Development, Staging [QA], Production) in alignment so you can minimize risk to your production release process.  I'll show you how we have been able to keep application database releases from spiraling out of control and give us the ability to rollback and respond to rapidly changing environments and how to release what was truly testing in the staging tier. Rapid development requires rapid changes to the database schema and with the change of database schema come some difficulties that can be managed to reduce downtime and scale-ability. </description>

      <title>Hadoop, Hive, JSON, and Data! Oh, my!</title>
      <description>Tips and Tricks and Painful lessons learned as I have ventured into the world of Hadoop, JSon and Hive. Our data has made the move from a relational database to a JSon structure, and reporting across the entire enterprise of data has changed. We have introduced Hadoop batch processing to our ETL processes to collect and process data from various locations, depositing them in various other locations. Along the way, various brick walls were surmounted. We will discuss some of these brick walls. Some of the oddities encountered in this journey. and hopefully prepare you for a similar trip, without all the pain we suffered.</description>

      <title>15  Things to ensure survivability of your database</title>
      <description>Survivability of data should be the #1 priority for any database administrator. Corruption can happen to any database at any time. How soon corruption is detected and a quick response is key to minimize lost data and recovery in a timely manner. Have a plan ready when it happens, as this is one time you don’t want to “learn on the job”. In addition to daily and monthly maintenance that should be performed, other topics discussed will include e-mail notification when data becomes corrupt and Service Level Agreements.</description>
