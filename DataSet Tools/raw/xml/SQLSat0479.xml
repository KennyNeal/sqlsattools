      <title>Implementing DevOps methodologies to improve application deployment</title>
      <description>DevOps is a about aligning SQL Server DBAs and Development teams to utilise agile methodologies and continuous integration to optimise application rollouts.

Hamish will discuss the importance of DevOps in industry and how it is a method to leverage people, processes, and tools to remove barriers and improve service delivery. 

DevOps methodologies and culture can help teams to respond faster to competitive pressures by replacing error prone (human) processes with automation so that the experience of production deployments are more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we will look at continuous integration/delivery methods for both applications and databases. Hamish will use a live demo to illustrate the concepts of continuous integration  delivery and show the rewards of reliable production deployment.

      <title>DBA life made easier with SQL Server 2016 - Query Store and LQS</title>
      <description>DBA always faces challenges in troubleshooting live performance issues. In SQL Server 2016, the two new features introduced to help a DBA to be more productive. The Query Store is a feature that will help in visualizing what is happening with your executing queries, which otherwise is hard to collect with DMVs. The UI rich interface makes it easier to troubleshoot live scenarios as well has collect data for troubleshooting. Have you ever felt a need to see the execution plan when executing a query while troubleshooting? Live Query Statistics helps you view the live execution plan rather than waiting till end of the execution of query to see the actual execution plan. This session is recommended for advanced users as you will need basic understanding of troubleshooting using execution plans. </description>

      <title>High Availability for SQL Server Standard Edition</title>
      <description>SQL Server High Availability is normally spoken about with Enterprise Edition features, however not all of us use Enterprise Edition, so what do we have in Standard Edition? In this session we will look at what options we have for building Highly Available systems in Standard Edition.

Looking at how to combine the different features such as clustering, mirroring and the new basic Availability Groups so that you can have much of the capability that you see in Enterprise Edition but without the high cost. I will demonstrate some of the ways that we can build solutions that are accessible to all with design patterns that you can upgrade to Enterprise at a later date if you upgrade your systems. </description>

      <title>A Lap Around Columnstore.</title>
      <description>Columnstore indexing was first introduced in SQL Server 2012.  
The technology was designed to give significant performance gains for datawarehouse queries. 
This initial version required some creative thinking to get all of the promised performance gains. This meant that adoption rates were not that high. 
However, SQL Server 2014 added significant functionality, which SQL Server 2016 builds upon. Come along and get a lap around this feature and find out how its adoption could help your organisation.
Attendees should leave this session will enough knowledge about the storage, architecture and query enhancements to implement a successful columnstore feature and administer it.

      <title>Hitting the SQL Server "Go Faster" Button</title>
      <description>Tuning individual queries is incredibly resource intensive.  Everyone wants a "Go Faster" button that will improve performance across the entire SQL instance.  While there is no sp_gofaster command to run, there are a bunch of magic knobs and switches that can quite often achieve the desired results.
  In this session we'll look at some of the things you can do to get the best performance out of your SQL Server workload.  You'll leave with a shopping list of things to check and options to try in your environments to get the performance you are after.</description>

      <title>Managing and Monitoring SQL Server for $0 without sacrificing functionality, performance or data…</title>
      <description>One of the most important aspects of  DBAs role is making sure your servers and the databases housed on them are up and performing as expected.  Not only does this mean reacting if (when) something goes wrong. You need to be proactive and work towards identifying potential issues before they occur. In addition, with proper monitoring you can often identify ways to improve performance for "free"

This session covers using features built into Windows, SQL Server as well as extending with free 3rd-party components and solutions.</description>

      <title>Performance Based Indexing</title>
      <description>SQL server indexes need to be effective so that data could be manipulated with minimum resource consumption. Having too few indexes will result in scanning full tables and having too many indexes will result in incurring un-necessary costs in keeping the index up-to-date. Even if the number of indexes "seem" sufficient, de-fragmenting is only one side of the story. In this session, we will cover index creation best practices and demo sql cache based index tuning, duplicate indexes, and more.

      <title>Embracing Database Theft</title>
      <description>In a day and age where database theft is becoming increasingly more frequent, why do we continue to be negligent of our duty to protect user data? Why is it that we have a raft of security features made available to us within SQL Server, and strong cryptographic libraries and solid object-relational mapping frameworks at our disposal, but still opt for insecure alternatives? In this session we'll explore the consequences of directing application development down the better known and more convenient path, and why approaching it from the perspective that your data will inevitably be stolen is what will give you the best chance of surviving a breach.</description>
