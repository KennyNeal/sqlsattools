      <title>Mastering and Enhancing Company Data</title>
      <description>Getting a good 360 degree view of organizations (customers or vendors) or doing customer centric analysis is often complicated as a result of bad data/ duplicate data / inconsistent data coming from multiple systems. In addition, there are external factors like mergers and acquisitions, inter-company relationships and other nuances that may not be captured in source systems. Getting a clear picture of customer and vendor data can not only provide a clear picture for analysis of information, but also aid in critical risk management functions. In this session, you will learn about some techniques and data services from DB that you can use to clean and enhance your data.</description>

      <title>So What is Power BI?</title>
      <description>This session will provide the attendee with an introduction to Power BI Desktop and how to use it with external data sources (sources may vary but could include Web Sites, SharePoint, SQL Server, Excel, Text, or Access). It will compare and contrast it with the features of Power Pivot and Power Chart.  Along with way, it will cover some basic table editing techniques, working with data from multiple data sources, and creating multiple visualizations on the same desktop that will interact with each other during the data analysis.  This session might be of special interest to anyone currently using Power Pivot, Power Chart, or Power View to see how this tool can be integrated into their toolbox of Business Intelligence skills.</description>

      <title>Building Defense in Depth Using the Full Spectrum of SQL Server Encryption</title>
      <description>As the threat of Cybercrime and data breaches increases, it is important to know and understand the variety of options available to protect Personally Identifying Information and other business sensitive data. You need to be prepared to defend yourself from the threat of data theft by learning about and combining methods of encrypting data at rest and in transit. In this presentation, you will learn about encrypting data at rest, data in transit, securing the channels through which data is transported and other topics related to cryptography in SQL Server including details about validating certificates and preventing man in the middle attacks against your server. Other topics include an overview of replicating encrypted data and designing systems so that the DBA can't decrypt the data. By the end of the session, you will understand how and when to use and combine every available encryption feature to design a defense in depth strategy for protecting data from escaping your network.  </description>

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.</description>

      <title>Automating Database Restores</title>
      <description>Beginning DBA's think of a RESTORE as something that gets done when something goes wrong. In practice we restore all the time, perhaps most often to refresh our QA and Development environments. Doing one restore isn't hard, but what about when you get five or ten requests a day? It's not just the restore either, you have to alter permissions, change the recovery model, set the database owner, perhaps update synonyms or mask out sensitive data. Restores are a pattern and if we see the pattern, we can do things to make it faster and repeatable.

This presentation will show you the latest version of the system I use, one consisting of a couple of tables and a couple of Powershell scripts. I'll start with my design goals, show you some of the compromises I made to get to a solution that handles 90% or so of the requests, and some of the options I thought about but decided against. I used Powershell, but  it's a pattern you could solve using another language, even perhaps TSQL!</description>

      <title>Automating Your Database Deployments</title>
      <description>Deploying your database changes to production can be nerve-wracking as you introduce changes while attempting to protect your data. In order to take the stress out of these deployments, you must ensure that you practice your deployments before you ever get near production. This session shows how automating the deployment and testing processes through your various development and pre-production environments can make the whole experience of production deployments more repeatable, more reliable and more robust.

In this session, we'll explore the concepts of continuous integration and continuous delivery for databases – what to consider, the challenges, the benefits, the testing, and the crucial approval gates necessary for a reliable production deployment. We'll discuss these and other release strategies as you think about how to evolve your deployment pipeline towards a more automated approach, starting with continuous integration and ending at your production systems.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Lockdown in Six Steps</title>
      <description>I will review the fundamentals needed to define a configurable permission model that allows database administrators to do routine work without having unfettered access to business data. 

I will demonstrate that many DBA tasks can be done without sysadmin access and explain what permissions are required for the most common tasks. Attendees will learn how to deploy a permission model that allows DBAs to do routine work and how to elevate permissions quickly to respond to emergencies. 

I will demonstrate  T-SQL and PowerShell scripts that secure the database server, undo the permission model in case of unforeseen circumstances, and discover which servers are non-compliant.

Attendees will leave this session with the realization that DBAs don’t need to be sysadmin as often as typically believed, that most administration tasks can be done without elevated permissions, and with the means to deploy this model in their own environment.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been thrown into a position where upper management wants to analyze and report off their data and your in charge? Are you writing complex T-SQL scripts and know there is a better way to achieve your goal? Maybe a multi-dimensional cube is just the answer your looking for. But do you know how to build it? In this session we will look at a data warehouse and build a small cube from the ground up. We will define a basic star schema and how to use it within a SSAS solution. We will look at the frame work around the cube such as the fact table, dimensions, attribute relationships, dimension usage, measures, and partitions. You will also learn a few tricks along the way to optimize for performance. </description>

      <title>SQL Server Disaster Recovery and High Availability Overview</title>
      <description>When it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with SQL Server, there are a lot of options. Most business owners (and many DBAs) lump disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) together. And while they do share some pieces, they also call for different strategies. Should you use one or more of these options? And what criteria should you use to make the choice? It’s important that you understand the decision tree that can guide you to select the right option(s) for your organization and that you can clearly explain those choices to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated. This session will give you a high-level understanding of the options, their costs and complexities, and reasons for using each of them.

      <title>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</title>
      <description>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures, filled with table variables, instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cut that work from hours or days to minutes or even seconds. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods</description>

      <title>Windowed Functions - Harness the Power to Forecast with Ease!</title>
      <description>In this session, we will do a brief walk through of what windowed functions are, how they execute, and the power that can be realized with them to do advanced computations such as moving averages, running totals, and forecasting. Once we get into the forecasting piece, we will walk through a forecasting model and show how we can leverage windowed functions to take complex calculations and make them easy to interpret. We will also illustrate why windowed functions are much more efficient than the typical update/inner join aggregate for running totals.
At the end of this session, the goal is to empower you to go back to your organization and be able to build a forecasting model in just T-SQL.</description>

      <title>Beginning Powershell for DBAs 1.0</title>
      <description>The time has come where DBAs can no longer afford to ignore powershell. Not only has it become an integral part of SQL Server, but we’re being asked to do things on a much grander scale than ever before; things that can only be done with powershell. This session will take you from nothing and explain what powershell is all about. I’m going to show you how the more things change the more they stay the same and if you master the basics of powershell in this session, you’ll be able to work with powershell not only in SQL Server, but also at the file system level, in Exchange, IIS, Windows, and anything else. So in this session I’m going to show you the basics you need to get your powershell career started.</description>

      <title>Data Migration Using BIML</title>
      <description>Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.</description>

      <title>Designing Stored Procedure Solutions</title>
      <description>With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.</description>

      <title>Planning and Executing a Successful SQL Server Database Migration</title>
      <description>Migrating an existing database to SQL Server requires much more than just moving the schema and data.  They key to a successful database migration effort includes designing the target system, identifying all components from the existing system that will need to be migrated, and allowing adequate time for changes and testing. 

In this session we will discuss all the different database components and configuration items that will need to be considered during the migration effort, how to utilize the SQL Server Migration Assistant as a planning and implementation tool, what components cannot be migrated (and what can be done about it),  and pitfalls to avoid during the development, testing, and final implementation.</description>

      <description>Do you want to be able to monitor multiple database servers using SSMS, and execute commands such as checking which servers have a specific login, run a DBCC command on 50 servers at the same time, select records from multiple servers as a single output, identify blocking commands on your SQL Server farm, or even check the error log of multiple servers using a single SQL command? What about sending a SMS when the 'sa' user is currently connected?
Now you can do this and more with Enzo Unified, the data server platform that unleashes the power of SQL Server.</description>

      <description>People are aware that you can use an execution plan to tune a query, but do they have other uses? This session will drill down on all the hidden information within execution plans. The structures and information with an execution plan shows many of the inner workings of SQL Server. From calculated columns to referential integrity, these, and many other functions, are exposed through execution plans. From this session you’ll be able to better understand the inner workings of SQL Server as well as your own databases and queries.</description>

      <title>Indexing your Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>One of the primary skill sets most database professionals are initially required to “master” is the art of proper indexing in our databases. We learn early on that an effective indexing configuration will go further in making our databases perform efficiently than probably any other single tuning technique. What’s not so commonly discussed though are the varying approaches one may wish to utilize when indexing your SQL Server enterprise data warehouse.  This session will hopefully cause you to take a good look at your current indexing to see if indeed it could be operating even more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Back Up and Restore? Piece of Cake!</title>
      <description>Backup and Restore? Piece of Cake!? Right? Backing up our databases is key to protecting our environment. Do you know your backup schedules, backup location and what is required
from the business if a recovery is required? Essentially your RTO and RPO? It is too late to late to identify these items when you receive the call to start a database recovery. During this webinar I am going to share my thoughts, what I document, and concepts around backup and recovery procedures for you databases. So when you receive that call to recover a database you can say “Piece of Cake”.</description>

      <title>Inside the Query Optimizer</title>
      <description>When it comes to SQL Server one of the biggest request you hear is “How can I make my Query Run FASTER!?”.  The answer understanding the first step in that process Is understanding the Query Optimizer.  Understanding the Optimizer beings with knowing the Rules.  The way our queries are written reflect directly on the output that we get. In this session we will look at the rules in SQL Server, write queries to show those rules in action, and walk out with a better understanding of how the Optimizer works.</description>

      <title>SSIS Factory</title>
      <description>Assume you have 100's of packages already developed and running in production. How long it will take to find the package that affect a particular table? Want to automate the search through all packages instead of opening each of them manually and checking them? Can it be more interesting if the conversion of those 2008 packages to 2012/2014 and deploy it to the new SSISDB using project deployment model? You can do it through C# (or VB) code using SSIS SDK with your C# scripting skills that you use in SSIS packages.  You can also create new SSIS packages to load text/excel files that receive from a vendor even if you don't know the file structure. Let's have some fun.. </description>

      <title>Solving Real Business Problems Step by Step</title>
      <description>When you’re first starting out, queries can be daunting. The experts on your team seem to do it instinctively. But the flexibility of T-SQL makes it seem near impossible to translate a business problem into an executed query.

Luckily, we’ve developed a set of rough guidelines to do just that. In this session, we deconstruct the ad-hoc query in the context of real business problems. We will explore and test our step-by-step approach using the AdventureWorks database as our sandbox, as if you are an employee for Adventure Works and you’ve just been handed a problem to solve.</description>
