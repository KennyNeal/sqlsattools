      <title>Detect Worst Performing SQL Queries During Peak Hour</title>
      <description>How many times you have been thrown in a situation when you have been asked to fix performance issues of a database system which you have never seen before? Where do you start tuning? When do you stop tuning? Each application is different. With the ever increasing number of systems one production DBA has to manage today, it's very important to use TOP to BOTTOM approach to troubleshoot performance issues, which will lead to the answers in the right way for the application under consideration. 

While you can find top queries, wouldn't it be awesome if you can find out which ones are the exact queries taking most of the resources in last hour and current situation? Now you can focus on those specific queries!

In this session, Prakash walks you through with scenario  demos to find which exact queries are taxing production systems resources based on CPU/DISK/Memory/Network. They are all based on his own real-life experience from managing demanding database systems.</description>

      <title>Table Partitioning -Beyond the Basics</title>
      <description>You've read about table partitioning; you know that partitioning ‘promises’ to solve some performance issues, make backups -and even restores, faster, and, wait, wait, there’s more! Perhaps you have worked through demo code and set up a POC scenario. It looks good, like maybe it would solve some of the problems your organization faces.

But …

You’re just not sure how to pull it off. Sure, the demo code made it seem easy -and it will always be realtively simple for new tables, new data. You have a handle on the ‘basics’. However, your production database has very large tables, hundreds of millions, or even billions, of rows. The SLA does not allow much, if any, downtime.

This session will look at how Table Partitioning can be introduced into existing production environments with little or no downtime And we will explore the ‘real’ performance and maintenance benefits that can be harvested. So, if you want to move beyond the ‘Basics’, don’t miss this session.

      <title>Data Pages, Allocation Units, IAM chains... Oh My!</title>
      <description>Understanding how SQL Server organizes your data under the hood can seem like a daunting task. In this session we’ll take a look at how objects such as tables and indexes are stored in the data file. We’ll also look at how these concepts tie in to your work as a DBA or developer. We’ll see these concepts in action using demos and see how we can use this knowledge to better design solutions.

We’ll start off by looking at the structure of a row and then move on the concept of a data page. From there we’ll cover a few special page types like the index allocation map. Then we’ll look at index structures and talk about the differences between heaps and clustered indexes. </description>

      <title>The New Revolution in Data Science, R Integrated into SQL Server</title>
      <description>Data Science is an ever increasing topic in the Data Analytics space and the R language is at the center of most conversations. R is an open source statistical language that is rapidly gaining popularity due to a robust set of machine learning functionality and a never-ending set of R packages that are used to increase functionality of the core R language. The R language is run as a desktop application and was not built with performance and scale required to accommodate Big Data. Revolution Analytics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, has solved the performance and scaling issues of a desktop application by creating a more robust enterprise architecture. SQL Server 2016 brings the power of R and Revolution Analytics into the industry leading relational database. 

This session will demo the functionality and power of using R within SQL Server.

      <title>PolyBase in SQL Server 2016: Query Hadoop with ease</title>
      <description>With the increased volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data , organizations are adopting heterogeneous data stores like Hadoop and cloud, requiring new skill sets to operate and making it harder for DBAs to build applications over them. This session will describe PolyBase, a new feature in SQL Server 2016, that will open the doors to data stored outside of SQL Server. PolyBase allows customers to use T-SQL to access and query data residing in Hadoop or Azure blob storage. It can intelligently push-down computation to Hadoop by generating Map jobs on-the-fly as well as scale-out query processing in SQL Server to enable highly performant queries on massive Hadoop data sets. 

This session will cover the PolyBase fundamentals of what the feature is, how customers are using it and how it works under-the-covers. In addition, the session will include a Live Demonstration of how PolyBase can be used to bring relational and semi-structured data together using SQL skill sets.</description>

      <title>The Key to Keys</title>
      <description>So many of us have learned  database design approaches from working with one database or data technology. We may have used only one data modeling or development tool.  That means our vocabularies around identifiers and keys tend to be product specific.  Do you know the difference between a unique index and a unique key? What about the difference between RI, FK and AK?

These concepts span data activities and it's important that your team understand each other and where they, their tools and approaches need to support these features.

We'll look at the generic and proprietary terms for these concepts, as well as where they fit in the database design process.  We'll also look at implementation options in SQL Server and other DBMSs.

      <title>Metadata-driven schema evolution - building robust ELT workflows</title>
      <description>Hadoop excels at running many large ETL/ELT workflows that previously ran on more expensive proprietary platforms. But when legacy tools and techniques are simply ported to work with Hadoop, they often bring the same legacy issues - brittleness due to their inability to support rapidly changing data sources and structures. And when more resilient processes are built to support an agile data lake, they often forgo metadata management, which makes later consumption by applications and users more difficult.

This presentation will discuss combining a metadata-driven schema evolution platform with existing tools in the Hadoop ecosystem (especially Hive and Impala) to:
* Gracefully handle schema evolution of data sources during extraction
* Drive more robust ingestion and processing workflows
* Lower effort and cost of integrating new data sources
* Enable first class metadata query operations / applications
* Support data governance requirements</description>

      <title>In BI, one size does not fit all</title>
      <description>Don’t be fooled by a vendor’s claims that their BI tool is all you need to solve your organization’s business intelligence needs.  In this session we will discuss the varied business intelligence needs of an organization and how to solve them.  Understand the differences between reporting and analytics and between self-service needs and the needs of IT.  We will see examples of using the best tools for the best job and bringing them together in a unified interface.</description>

      <title>Phone Book Phun - Learning database concepts with the White Pages</title>
      <description>Come with me back to a simpler time - a time where children played outside by light from a streetlamp, people still listened to music on a cassette tape, and if you wanted to call someone, you looked up their phone number in the phone book (all the while learning some important database concepts).  

Wait...  what was that last part? In this session, you'll gain a deeper understanding of key indexing concepts such as clustering, included columns, sargability, and more through the lens of the good old White Pages.</description>

      <title>Hardware for Nothing, Get Your Flash for Free</title>
      <description>By now, Tier 1 apps deployed on flash is ubiquitous.  However, Tier 2 apps often remain relegated to spinning media.  This presentation explains the economics of consolidating on flash.  Owing to the SQL Server core licensing model, licensing a 2-socket commodity server can cost up to $500,000 or more!  Consolidating instances on flash can—and does—save hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.  This presentation provides real-life case studies showing such real-life savings.</description>

      <title>Establishing a SLA</title>
      <description>Most DBA's rarely establish Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the Management and if they do they sometimes just come up with some random numbers for availability. Then when at some point something goes really wrong everybody wonders why it takes so long to bring everything back online.
#160;
This Session will teach you how to ask the right questions, analyze your databases and servers and generate from the gathered data a realistic SLA.

      <title>Transaction Log Fundamentals</title>
      <description>ACID anyone?

Over time SQL Server management has become more and more automated and wizard-driven. With this automation there is less understanding of the fundamentals of the database, starting with the transaction log.

This session will remind the audience about the function of the transaction log, as well as what does (or doesn't) get written to the transaction log. This session will touch on topics such as SQL Server Replication and the impact it has on the transaction log, as well as the truncation point.

And acronyms such as ACID will be clarified.</description>

      <title>How Good Is Your Indexing Strategy?</title>
      <description>Like Frankenstein's Monster (or our teenagers) things get released into the wild and behave differently than planned - database usage patterns are no different.  Join Tim as he reviews what to look for when tweaking your index strategy: poor clustering key decisions, underutilized indexes, covering indexes gone wrong, overlooked heaps and fill factor failures are just a few of the blunders to be identified.  

A working knowledge of Dynamic Management Objects, indexing internals, and eagerness to experiment with metadata is a prerequisite!</description>
