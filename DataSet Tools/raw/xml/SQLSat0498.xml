      <title>Context  Calculation: Back to the Basics with DAX</title>
      <description>The learning curve for DAX isn't a straight line - it starts off gradual and quickly gets steep.  With a syntax similar to Excel, DAX seems easy enough for an Excel power user but things quickly get confusing without a good foundation in the basics of DAX.  Those basics - context and calculation - are the topic for this session.

This session is for the intermediate DAX user who has produced some quality data models and DAX calculations but who is still having difficulties with functions around filtering, time intelligence, and complex calculations.  We'll go through a number of practical examples that show that DAX at a fundamental level is a combination of creating filter and row CONTEXTS and then using those contexts to produce CALCULATIONS.  Understanding this concept is a must to produce more complex code in DAX and it's also a very useful framework for someone just getting started.</description>

      <title>Data Migration Using BIML</title>
      <description>Many companies scale out their databases horizontally, partitioning data by customer (or some other identifier) into separate databases or instances.  Sometimes, it becomes important to move that data from one database to another.  SQL Server Integration Services is a fantastic tool for ETL, but creating and maintaining dozens or hundreds of data flows by hand is exhaustingly tedious.  Instead of doing it the hard way, use the BI Markup Language (BIML) to automate package development.  This talk will show how we can use metadata tables and BIML to auto-create SSIS packages to migrate data from one database to another, handling foreign key constraints along the way.</description>

      <title>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</title>
      <description>As a beginner database professional, execution plans are intimidating. In this  session, I will take you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drill into key operators, warnings and properties.

You will understand how, why and when the execution plan will be created and saved to plan cache.

Reading the execution plan will be much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. 

After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance tuning opportunities.

Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan, save it for analysis and comparison after modifications have occurred.

      <title>Pragmatic Power BI:  Transforming Data</title>
      <description>Once we’ve extracted data from a source, we typically need to clean, or otherwise change, that data in preparation for loading it into Power BI.  In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson will explore the options Power BI offers to unpivot, filter, sort, aggregate, and perform other needed operations to make these preparations.  We’ll employ a dataset containing issues that commonly present real-world challenges, and work through the steps we can take in Power BI to transform the data to a state that works within Power BI.  Moreover, we’ll define calculations, and get a glimpse of the M language that underlies transformational processes we construct.</description>

      <description>So you have a handle on basic PowerShell, and are ready to take the next step into deeper PowerShell. In this session we'll look at four topics critical to taking your PowerShell skills to the next level. 

We'll start with some techniques for debugging the scripts you are developing. Next security will be examined, where you'll see how to properly set security for your environment. Closely associated with security is the topic of code signing, a technique that allows you to further enhance the security in your environment. 

The session will wrap up with a discussion of Remoting, a technique allowing you to execute PowerShell scripts and commands against other machines on your infrastructure. </description>

      <title>A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics</title>
      <description>You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel and SQL Server Management Studio, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

      <title>Advanced Error Tracking for Quick Diagnosis</title>
      <description>In this session, we will walk through how to build a detailed error notification service for SQL Server that will trap errors, and email you a well formatted and detailed error report on what went wrong. In many organizations, you typically have SQL agent jobs running, and when failures occur, you get a generic email with a jumbled up message about the error, but it doesn't really help you understand where and at what point did your stored procedure fail.
In this class, we will introduce and go through how to pinpoint errors in real time, and how to identify troubling areas or bottlenecks in stored procedures. In the end, you will have a notification and error handling system that sends you a well formatted email alert with an html table output to show you the events that led up to the error, and what exactly the error was.
This toolset has saved many developers and DBA's tons of time researching failures in jobs, and we hope it helps you too!</description>

      <title>Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?!?</title>
      <description>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft has since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging (ETL) and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the "Wickham stack" which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. The “Wickham stack” includes the ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr packages. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may encounter.</description>

      <title>Building Unconventional SQL Server Tools in PowerShell</title>
      <description>Ever had records from a SQL Server database table come up missing? Maybe someone or some process deleted them, but who really knows what happened to them? Wouldn’t it be awesome to create a free tool with PowerShell that automates the task of sifting through the transaction log backups and even the active transaction log to determine when deletes occurred for a specific database and what user deleted those records along with the Log Sequence Number that the database needs to be restored to so the missing records can be recovered? During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will walk you through his custom SQL PowerShell module which includes functions for querying SQL Server with PowerShell from a client machine without requiring the installation of the SQL PowerShell module or snap-in, querying transaction logs for insert, update, and delete operations, and automated point in time recovery of a database by only having to specify the point in time to perform the recovery to.</description>

      <title>Connecting Power BI to On-Prem Data with SSAS</title>
      <description>Microsoft Power BI is going great places. Its great visualizations, easy-to-use tools, and robust sharing capabilities are improving with new releases almost every time you turn around. But, what if uploading or storing your company's data in the cloud is a potential deal-breaker? Fortunately, the Microsoft Power BI Gateway - Enterprise make it possible to live query data in an on-premises SSAS instance for display in Power BI. In this session, we will go through what this gateway does, how it works, and how it is installed to show that BI in the cloud doesn't require data in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Smart Rats Leave First</title>
      <description>Rats leave a sinking ship.  Smart rats leave first.  Changing jobs is always going to be stressful, but it can be a great opportunity for career growth.  Recognizing when it is time to make a change can be the difference between taking a step up on the career ladder or having to find a "lifeboat" job.  We will discuss how to recognize when it is time to move on, how to manage your job search and your current job, and finally how to exit a job professionally.  </description>

      <title>SQL Server Always On - The Good, The Bad and the Ugly</title>
      <description>SQL Server Always on architecture was deployed with the SQL Server 2012 Engine.  

This session will review terms for high availability and review our implementation of a 10TB data warehouse.    This is an intermediate session, that will not show all of the details of setup, but will review what worked (the good), some unique features (the bad) and cover a couple of outages (the ugly) along the road to a successful deployment of the Always On architecture.   </description>

      <title>Top 10 Wait Types Everyone Should Know</title>
      <description>There are over 800 wait types in SQL Server 2014, but there are only 10 (in my experience) that are seen very often. If you can learn these 10 wait types, what causes them and their solutions, you will be ahead of the performance analysis game. The list of 10 wait types to be discussed came from over 100 consulting engagements with customers, so come find out what they are and improve your performance troubleshooting skills.</description>

      <title>Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?</title>
      <description>Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away.</description>

      <title>Achieve More in Less Time by Using SQLPS</title>
      <description>Let’s face it, using SQLPS prior to SQL Server 2016 was like installing training wheels on a Ducati.   Then, some community feedback was incorporated before SQL 2016 shipped and presto, SQLPS is actually useful all of a sudden.

There is a faster way to manage and even SQL Servers using PowerShell.  I will show you what the new features in SQLPS and why you will probably find it useful, even if you aren't a "DBA".
