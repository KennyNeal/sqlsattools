      <title>So what does it really take to get to four nines</title>
      <description>As ones responsibilities grow as a senior Database Administrator many more factors come into play to achieving both the realities and perception of high availability.  The building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures are all critical components to success.   While some Database Administrator will argue this is out of my scope of responsibilities why should I care about building of professional relationships, managing expectations, helping with setting standards and procedures?  The answer is simple because the perception is that no matter where the process breaks down it’s always a database problem.  Managing customer expectations what do you really mean by 99.99% up time, Translating business requirements to operational realities, commonly overlooked items that impact your 4 nines  Avoiding human errors the realities and perception of high availability.</description>

      <title>Overview of Security Investments in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database</title>
      <description>Join me for an overview of the most recent security investments for SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database in the areas of encryption, data filtering and data masking. I will showcase a real-life user scenario with examples and demos of Always Encrypted, Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking. The demos include a real working .NET application with source code for testing. This is based on the session and demos I co-presented with Microsoft at SQL Summit 2015 so if you missed Summit or the presentation and are interested in learning what Microsoft is doing in the area of security in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL DB then this is the session for you.

      <title>Introduction to R and Data Science Tools in the Microsoft Stack</title>
      <description>R is the most popular statistics language used today. It is one of the most useful tools in the data scientist's tool belt. It is also integrated into the MS stack in tools like Azure ML, SQL Server and Power BI and can be used to take your data analytics to the next level.

Come to this session to get an introduction to the R language including installing and configuring R and RStudio, how to access and manipulate data, install packages, create and use variables, use control flows and some basic graphing and statistical analysis. We will finish with a very brief introduction of how R integrates in Azure ML, Power BI and SQL Server.

The focus of the session will be primarily on the introduction to the R language and getting attendees comfortable with using R to start the journey to Data Science! </description>

      <title>Designing Stored Procedure Solutions</title>
      <description>With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about: 

Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success
Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance
Reevaluating and expanding on your solution
Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors
Choosing between alternate solutions
Evaluating for performance

This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Biml</title>
      <description>Have you ever needed to generate dozens (or even hundreds) of similar SSIS packages? Do you ever find yourself needing to regenerate a lot of packages when some piece of the upstream data format changes? Using native SSIS, this can be a tedious and error prone exercise. However, using Biml (Business Intelligence Markup Language) can greatly increase your productivity as an ETL developer.

In this session, we'll cover the essentials of Biml. I'll discuss what it is and what it can do for SSIS, demonstrating how it can easily generate dozens or even hundreds of packages in just a few minutes. I'll also demonstrate some realistic examples and discuss how Biml fits into the enterprise ETL picture.</description>

      <title>Making the Most of the SSIS Catalog</title>
      <description>Managing the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) ecosystem became significantly easier with the addition of the SSIS catalog in SQL Server 2012. The SSIS catalog offered many new features that made often-laborious tasks such as logging, parameterization, and variable collections much easier to develop and manage. For the SSIS developer as well as the operations staff in charge of day-to-day package execution, using the SSIS catalog helps to make their jobs easier by eliminating several tedious and error-prone processes.

In this session, we will survey and demonstrate many of the useful features of the SSIS catalog. We will discuss the structure of the catalog and review how it changes the way we interact with deployed packages in SSIS. We will also demonstrate how parameters and SSIS environments help to ease the burden of supplying runtime configuration values to packages. In addition, we will demonstrate how package logging is a far simpler exercise in the new SSIS catalog.

      <title>Profiler is Dead! Long Live Extended Events!</title>
      <description>Did you know that Profiler and SQL Trace are deprecated? I know it still works (even in SQL Server 2016 CTP2), but it will never be updated with the latest features. In fact it will never be updated at all! That means if you want to capture information about any new feature, from version SQL Server 2012 and beyond, you need to use another tool. 
That new tool is Extended Events (XE). Not only has it replaced Profiler, and can be used to capture information on all new features, but it is a substantially better tool! 
In this session we will discuss the architecture of Extended Events, how to setup a new trace from scratch or convert an existing Profiler trace, and the new abilities that never existed in Profiler. We will also cover the difference in overhead cost of Profiler and Extended Events.  
Profiler was a friend of mine, but it is time to embrace the new king! </description>

      <title>Actively Proactive – Straightforward Ways to Manage and Diagnose SQL</title>
      <description>Becoming a proactive DBA is something that most SQL administrators strive to be but many fall short.  Meetings, doing non-SQL related tasks, excessive workload and sometimes corporate culture often work against a DBA by creating conditions where it is nearly impossible to pay attention to the tasks involved in taking care of your SQL instances.  Our presentation will cover those proactive tasks and alerts that will provide a straightforward method of ensuring that maintenance and monitoring are working for all SQL instances you are responsible for.  Additionally, we will cover some ways to identify emergency performance problems that will allow a DBA to quickly resolve issues while making them look like the expert they truly are.</description>

      <title>Monster Text Manipulation: Regular Expressions for the DBA</title>
      <description>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort. Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures, filled with table variables, instead of temp tables? Need to move 500 databases to a different drive? Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cut that work from hours or days to minutes or even seconds. Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you. Learn:
• The most useful regular expression commands
• The appropriate times to use regular expressions
• How to use regular expressions to write code for you
• How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods</description>

      <title>Who's Afraid of Entity Framework?</title>
      <description>Do any applications in your environment use SQL written not by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are it is using the Microsoft Entity Framework (EF).

EF and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is EF a technology that developers should even be using? This session reviews what EF is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how it works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by EF Finally, we'll review EF-generated T-SQL and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional who manages databases that are accessed through EF or want a basic knowledge of how EF works, this session is for you.</description>

      <title>Secure your sensitive data with Always Encrypted</title>
      <description>Data security is a major concern for organizations especially when they start to explore cloud-based data options. Microsoft is enhancing security options in almost every major release of SQL Server. In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has implemented “Always Encrypted” option which is quite different from previously available options including TDE. It is encryption of data not only at rest, but also in use and in transit. We will have a deep discussion about this new end-to-end data encryption feature which can be implemented without any code change on application side for both on premises and cloud SQL Server databases.</description>

      <title>The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality</title>
      <description>How would you like to learn about using Virtual Reality (VR) to present information? The ability to become immersed and walk around inside of a VR environment is a new and unique way to present and look at information. As data professionals we need to be open to novel displays of data and explore what VR can do that for us that we have not been able to do in the past. VR can provide a way for people to see relationships and interact among data sets which can be difficult for computers to display visually on a flat screen.

The Life Cycle of a Query in Virtual Reality is built using Epic Games video game engine called Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). With native support for VR, UE4 has been used for applications beyond just video games. With the commercial availability of affordable VR headsets, data professionals can now create visually compelling environments that were almost impossible or extremely expensive just a few years ago on both PC and mobile devices.

      <description>As part of the company’s “Get Current/Stay Current” initiative, Microsoft’s IT organization planned to upgrade its community website, answers.microsoft.com from Microsoft SQL Server 2008 to Microsoft SQL Server 2014. At the same time, the site adopted virtualization and needed to maintain the zero downtime environment the group had built with mirroring. Given the site spans four data centers across the globe and supports more than 1.7 million visitors a day, Microsoft cannot afford downtime, not even for maintenance. This case study shares best practices for upgrading to SQL Server 2014, highlights the technologies Microsoft considered to enable continuous availability, and details how the site leveraged AlwaysOn without making application changes.</description>

      <title>Codd's Rules, Normal Forms, and SQL Anti-Patterns - Recognition  Repair</title>
      <description>In 1970 E.F. Codd presented a seminal set of ideas now known as the Relational Model of Data.  Revolutionary for its time, these notions would give rise to many of the database engines of today including SQL Server.  Too many software developers and database designers though are unfamiliar with these ideas or do not know how to effectively apply them.  This presentation reviews Codd's rules and the relational normal forms; explains the differences between the relational model of data and the SQL database engines these ideas inspired; identifies some of the SQL anti-patterns that avoidance of these rules and normal forms gives rise to; and discusses both technical and organizational strategies for improving existing applications and their associated database designs and implementations.</description>

      <description>We don't just throw resources to a server until we can prove it is going to be utilized. I was often asked how to know and when the SQL Server system needs additional hardware resources? or we can trim down the excessive usage of resources?
It is a choice of judgement from experiences. The optimization goal is not to waste system resources but maintain database best performance. In this session, let me share with you my many years of experiences and show you the general rule of thumb to performance tuning.
We will go over the following topics of discussions for typical scenarios that applies to SQL Server generally (not a specific version).
The take-away is you would understand better what to do to help your SQL Server reach optimal performance and proactively prevent problems.

Memory:
IO:

      <title>SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?</title>
      <description>For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.</description>

      <title>Watch Brent Tune Indexes</title>
      <description>You're not starting from scratch - you have a database that's already in production, and you can't make too many changes to the app. You want to make it go faster with as little danger and disruption as possible. You're comfortable writing queries to get the data you need, but you're not so confident when it comes to picking the right nonclustered indexes. How many should you have? What fields should they be on?

In this session, you'll learn Brent Ozar's easy one-hour process to:

* Review the indexes you've already got
* De-duplicate your indexes to make inserts/updates/deletes go faster
* Find the right nonclustered indexes you need
* And use simple, free scripts that give you all the answers</description>

      <title>Change Tracking:  A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control</title>
      <description>Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture.  Change Tracking is now the red-headed step child, but in many cases may be a better solution for data ETL movement from an OLTP database to a data warehouse database.  This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos.  It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos.</description>

      <title>Using SQL to Avoid the SharePoint List Threshold</title>
      <description>What do you do when your SharePoint list exceeds the 5,000 item threshold? Do you turn off throttling for the list? Do you increase the limit in Central Admin? If either of these are your solution, you're risking a SQL database lockup, which could affect more than the one list. Based on a real world scenario, this session will share how a major healthcare institution recently used a SQL view containing 6,000+ items to avoid SharePoint's list threshold. Additionally, attendees will see how a Power View report built in SharePoint used the same SQL data to provide an interactive dashboard for data monitoring.</description>

This new feature allows SQL Server to automatically keep track of the history of rows in any table for which it is enabled. In this session we'll cover the basics on how to create and work with temporal tables, including the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME query clause, and we'll discuss some of the ways that they may or may not fill a need in your environment.</description>

      <title>Cluster@#$%! High Availability Solutions. What Could Go Wrong?</title>
      <description>If you have a high availability need in your production environment -- and who doesn't, these days -- you've probably had to think through the options. Clustering, Availabililty Groups, Mirroring, Replication, a third-party solution? 

Even when you make an informed decision about what high-availability implementation you'll use, are you sure it will come online and stay online? Join John in this review of some of the more prominent failures (and their solutions) in commonly used high-availability configurations. </description>

      <title>Beyond the Where: Full Text Search tips and tricks</title>
      <description>Lots of people know that Full Text Search is a powerful tool for searching unstructured data but did you know that you can utilize its power for structured data as well?  Functions like FREETEXTTABLE and CONTAINSTABLE open up some pretty groovy doors in terms of usability.  We’ll discuss ways to give your users that search engine like interface that everyone has grown accustomed to without sacrificing query performance.  We’ll also hit on creating synonyms to give your users results even when they aren’t quite sure what to search for.  It’s an entirely different type of search altogether.  </description>

      <title>Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Change Automation</title>
      <description>Automation and Continuous Delivery are at the forefront of software development processes today.  However, databases are being neglected because database code is different, harder to automate, and DBAs just don't seem to trust database automation. This is not surprising when you consider the number of incidents and instances of downtime that were caused by out-of-process updates, code overrides, and other database glitches. In this session, we will explain the options to automate database changes along with the benefits and issues with each option.</description>
