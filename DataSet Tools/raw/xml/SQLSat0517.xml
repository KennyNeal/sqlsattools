      <description>I#39;m a DBA who has gone through most of my career with few people to learn and unsure of where to find great help until I found a real mentor.  When I started at a company with a great, knowledgeable manager and learned to find others speaking about SQL Server online my skills boomed.  This is especially true in my most passionate area, SQL Server performance.  

Knowing that my knowledge came from others, I now have a second passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</description>

He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.</description>

      <title>Big data architectures and the data lake</title>
      <description>With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!</description>

      <title>Tips that have saved my bacon</title>
      <description>In this session, I propose to share some of the tricks I've used on the operational side of being a DBA.

There's saying, never perform small miracles, people to rely on them, but isn't it useful to have a few in your back-pocket. 

Everyone knows log-shipping is great for DR recovery, but what about using it for minor issues, like a delete or update gone bad? Want to move a large table someplace else (like that "oh it'll just be a small audit table, it won't grow large because we'll write the functionality later to keep it small" and they never do? UNC backups... an often overlooked but useful option for making a backup AND getting it off your server. Run a small operation where too many fingers have access to the operational DB and you want to catch them? These are some of the tricks I've picked up over the years and used more than once to perform small miracles and have saved my bacon or the bacon of others</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from t</title>
      <description>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. "Virtualize First" is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too "critical" to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!</description>

      <title>DevOps Is Coming to an Enterprise near You</title>
      <description>Companies are creating more and more technology service offerings, but they are often throttled by IT. To address this, many IT departments are adapting a new concept called DevOps. DevOps is a concept that has risen quickly from niche to mainstream within the IT enterprise. At its core, DevOps represents a way to leverage people, processes, and tools to remove barriers and improve service delivery. An understanding of scripting and automation platforms is becoming a critical skill for SQL Server professionals. This session discusses how technologies such as virtualization, the cloud, and software-defined datacenters have blurred the lines between developers and sysdmins. We also talk about the competencies and tools required to succeed in an increasingly data-driven workplace.</description>

      <title>Table Vars and Temp Tables – What you NEED to Know!</title>
      <description>Almost every SQL Developer is familiar with Table Variables and Temporary Tables. While each of these objects represents temporary storage, there are also substantial differences between them. Understanding the differences between Table Variables and Temporary Tables, and the ramifications that those differences cause, is essential to being able to properly select the appropriate object for use in your development tasks. In this code filled session, we’ll discover the differences and similarities of Temporary Tables and Table Variables, dispel some widespread myths about each, and answer the most important questions of them all, "When do I use one or the other and what are the various impacts of doing so?"</description>

      <title>Azure Machine Learning – Bringing Advanced Analytics to the Masses</title>
      <description>While Machine Learning is not new, it has never been easy to implement. Azure Machine Learning (AML) aims to provide a set of tools that are easier to use and once a model is created easier to consume by client applications. At the core of AML is ML Studio. ML Studio provides an easy to use graphical tool that allows you to control the process from pre-processing the data, to applying learning algorithms, testing the model, and finally deploying the model for use by client applications. This session guides you through the process of creating and deploying a ML model. In addition it will demonstrate how client applications can easily use the model once it is deployed.</description>

      <title>Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery</title>
      <description>I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Extended Events</title>
      <description>Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events.  Many DBA's continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years.  Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them.  Since then it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way.  You may never go back to Profiler again!</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2016 "Hidden Gems"</title>
      <description>By far the most important SQL Server release since the heady days of 2005, SQL Server 2016 represents a huge leap forward in a number of key areas. You've no doubt heard plenty about such features as Query Store, JSON support, Polybase, and the other big-ticket items. But there are also a number of very cool features that don't usually make the top 10 lists. In this talk you'll learn about enhancements to indexing (including both Columnstore and traditional b-tree indexes), DMVs, compression, string handling, encryption, configuration, and even timezone support. These smaller features may not be highlighted in the latest glossy ads from Microsoft's marketing department, but they're the kinds of things that add up to make your life easier. Attend this session to learn all sorts of new and different reasons to upgrade as quickly as possible.</description>

      <title>Common Coding Mistakes and How to Mitigate them</title>
      <description>Let the Big Bad Wolf huff, puff and blow your bad queries away.

There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code that do not scale well inside of SQL Server.

In this session we will focus some of these patterns and show you how to make them scale in the database engine. We will touch on Scalar-Value functions, Union, CTE, RBAR and more.

After this session, you can go back to your office Monday morning and be the code tuning rock star!</description>

      <description>While most of us still have some physical, on premises deployments of SQL Server, many of us are moving towards, or already have started deploying SQL Server instances and databases en masse either in virtual machines or in the public cloud. This session will discuss how you should approach availability in this new paradigm when things are both similar to the way we used to do things, but in other ways completely different. You will learn best practices for clustering SQL Server (both FCIs and AGs), how to think about quorum, and more.</description>

      <title>Architecting virtual SQL server for performance </title>
      <description>Today, many enterprise organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the author of the official SQL server on VMware best practices guide.  </description>

      <title>Row Level Security in the BI Environment</title>
      <description>Implementing Row Level Security in SQL Server, and also even Cell level security in SSAS, to mask data from other users is a common request and a component in your security and data access model for a data warehouse and BI environment.   Information is valuable, but will be a double edge sword if not protected, and should only made visible to only those that should receive it.   In this session, we describe the design considerations, highlight multiple scenarios for querying and reporting, and demonstrate how to apply Row Level Security in both pre-SQL 2016, and implementing it using the new Row Level Security feature in SQL 2016.    We will also touch on briefly cell level security in SSAS.              </description>

      <title>Extending PowerBI</title>
      <description>This will be a Co-presentation with Ed Bunt and Mark Wojciechowicz.

With PowerBI, we can easily create intuitive reports and dashboards.  This highly customizable environment can be extended in many ways, even outside its own environment.  In this session, we will look at how to create a custom visual, how to embed PowerBI in a custom application, how to integrate PowerBI with Cortana in windows 10, and, if we can think of anything else before June, we’ll do that too.

      <description>Throughout my career, I've seen developers do some pretty crazy things to databases (and truth be told, I've done some of these myself!). Come to this session to learn about SQL Injection attacks and how SQL can use Referential Integrity to optimze queries. Trust me... your DBA will love you for making these changes.</description>

      <title>10 Things Administrators of BI Systems Should Know</title>
      <description>Conversations about SQL Server administration tends to be all about administering OLTP systems. If you administrer BI systems, you can't apply everything you know about administering OLTP systems to BI systems. BI systems usually end up being administered by OLTP DBAs or by BI developers and architects. Where does one even find a BI Administrator?

Fortunately, I've been administering BI systems for several years, and I have learned the hard way the difference between administering OLTP and BI systems. This session will cover the top 10 things that I think an administrator of BI systems need to know.</description>

      <title>Parsing T-SQL using the TransactSql.ScriptDom library (C#)</title>
      <description>T-SQL is a very complicated language to parse, so it can be intimidating to get started. We'll go over basic concepts of what a lexer/parser is and what to expect from it. Then, using the TransactSql.ScriptDom library in the SQL Server SDK, we'll do some examples to get our feet wet.

      <title>Would You Just Load Already?!  Maximizing Your SSIS Data Load</title>
      <description>Loading data via SSIS is great! It’s fast too! Until you hit a bad record. Then things aren’t so great. Now you probably have to waste time dumping and reloading all the data, or worst figure out where the bad record is and try a partial load.

In this session you will learn a simple method to load data via SSIS and identify, remove, and record those bad records allowing you to maximize the amount of data loaded while ensuring data integrity.

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.

As part of this, we'll look at the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use. </description>
