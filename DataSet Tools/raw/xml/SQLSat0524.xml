      <description>I believe success on a global level requires leadership, a strong work ethic, innovation, but most importantly – working well as part of a team. I possess strong interpersonal communication skills, which were acquired in my jobs as a real estate agent, property manager, and enterprise software sales. My service in the Army helped shape my leadership skills. 

Through my education I attained business and technical skills including the ability to create databases, design systems and write basic codes in C++ and SQL. 

I have a very deep interest in BI and the financial sector. I acquire my financial knowledge through trading stocks, reading financial articles, and discussing recent events with friends who work in the industry.</description>

      <title>Architecting virtual SQL server for performance </title>
      <description>Today, many enterprise organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the author of the official SQL server on VMware best practices guide.  </description>

      <title>Scaling for best performance: Partitioned views.</title>
      <description>Partitioning has long been one of the key feature sets utilized to improve performance or reduce contention within our large tables in SQL Server. However, table partitioning has been solely the prerogative of SQL Server Enterprise edition.  Even though that is correct, there are techniques available to us in Standard edition which would accomplish the same result as table partitioning. 

In this session we will go through the steps needed to configure and use the partitioned views to achieve the same result as table partitioning. We will also configure the maintenance jobs to imitate the sliding window functionality, and for those of us who are lucky to have Enterprise edition, we will see how to be able to take advantage of combining both partitioned views and table partitioning as well as inMemory tables to give us an ability to use double partition elimination based on two different keys as well as the ability to move hot spots data into inMemory OLTP.

      <title>How SQL is helping to connect Cuba to the Web for free</title>
      <description>Salvi works on a non-profit that connects thousands of Cubans to the web, via email. In Cuba, 25% of the population can access to email only, while 5% access to the Web without restrictions. After three years of work, his non-profit organization has collected several gigs of data that can re-shape our understanding about Cuba. 

Salvi will show data collected by this great technology, and how fascinating can be interpreting row information from a country that has been censored internally and externally for generations . The audience will have a unique opportunity to learn this technology, access this data and to use their skills to make a worldwide impact.</description>

      <title>Seamlessly Scaling Azure SQL DB with Elastic Database Tools</title>
      <description>Elastic Database Tools for Azure SQL DB offers a set of features that make it easier to build and manage a scaled-out data tier for cloud applications. With elastic database tools, applications can easily access data spanning multiple DBs, coordinate management tasks and manage how data is distributed among them. As part of the session, we explore workloads that are a natural fit for Azure SQL DB's elastic database tools. Patterns discussed in depth include multi-tenant applications created by cloud ISVs and SaaS vendors, and applications relying on temporal data distribution. The session will illustrate how easy it is now to build, scale and manage cloud applications in SQL DB when using elastic tools capabilities such as the elastic database client library for .NET.  </description>

      <title>Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations</title>
      <description>With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.</description>

      <title>Query Data Store</title>
      <description>Analyzing query performance can be tricky. It involves knowing several dynamic management views (DMVs) and accessing query plans that are still in the query cache. If you need to get performance metrics for a query which is no longer in the cache, or if your server is restarted it will be an impossible task.
Query Data Store is a new  feature that comes to help DBAs. By persisting query execution data over time, it allows reviewing of statements / plans / properties / statistics.
This session will show you how to enable and use QDS features, like: obtaining queries with plan changes over time; analyze queries by CPU / Memory / other counters; forcing a plan; and other gems.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Disaster Recovery and High Availability Overview</title>
      <description>When it comes to disaster recovery and high availability with SQL Server, there are a lot of options. Most business owners (and many DBAs) lump disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) together. And while they do share some pieces, they also call for different strategies. Should you use one or more of these options? And what criteria should you use to make the choice? It’s important that you understand the decision tree that can guide you to select the right option(s) for your organization and that you can clearly explain those choices to the stakeholders. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but it is complicated. This session will give you a high-level understanding of the options, their costs and complexities, and reasons for using each of them.

      <title>A SQL Developer’s Guide to MDX Basics</title>
      <description>You already know how to write SQL queries against a data warehouse but your new job responsibilities require you to write MDX queries against Analysis Services (SSAS). MDX is the query language of SSAS in multidimensional mode. While SQL and MDX share some common keywords, they have very different syntax and concepts. In fact, the common keywords can be confusing if you are used to thinking in SQL. 
 
In this session you will explore how data is organized in SSAS in a data structure called a cube. Next, we will write MDX queries while comparing them with SQL queries that return similar results. You will see how certain queries are much easier to write in MDX, especially when it comes to querying data that contains hierarchies such as a date rollup. Finally, you will learn how to capture MDX queries generated by Excel, SQL Server Management Studio and other third party tools, to use as practical examples of how to write MDX queries.

      <description>Assume that you want to create packages to load 100's files (text or Excel) that you receive from vendors and structure of data in the files are different.  How long it can take? How about creating a simple tool for your manager who doesn't know anything about SSIS  to create packages for transferring data between servers?  You want to find out which package, among 100's of them  already running, update/insert a particular table . How long it will take to open each package and get the answer? 

We can automate all these process using C# (or Visual Basic) and SSIS SDK. Can it be more interesting if the conversion of those 2008 packages to 2012/2014 and deploy it to the new SSISDB using project deployment model can be automated too? If you are an SSIS expert with some knowledge of programming and like automation, you will have fun in this session.</description>

      <title>Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)</title>
      <description>Common Table Expressions (CTE) are a temporary result set used within an SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, that can be used in place of a subquery and can help simplify more complex queries such as when joining to the same result set multiple times.

We'll begin with an overview of how a Common Table Expression is constructed.  Then we'll build some queries using derived tables, and as the queries we build get more unwieldy, demonstrate how the query can be simplified by the use of a CTE.</description>

      <title>Building Defense in Depth Using the Full Spectrum of SQL Server Encryption</title>
      <description>As the threat of Cybercrime and data breaches increases, it is important to know and understand the variety of options available to protect Personally Identifying Information and other business sensitive data. You need to be prepared to defend yourself from the threat of data theft by learning about and combining methods of encrypting data at rest and in transit. In this presentation, you will learn about encrypting data at rest, data in transit, securing the channels through which data is transported and other topics related to cryptography in SQL Server including details about validating certificates and preventing man in the middle attacks against your server. Other topics include an overview of replicating encrypted data and designing systems so that the DBA can't decrypt the data. By the end of the session, you will understand how and when to use and combine every available encryption feature to design a defense in depth strategy for protecting data from escaping your network.  </description>

      <title>SQL Speaker Idol</title>
      <description>If you've ever enjoyed or admired the knowledge and know-how of a speaker at an event like this, remember that they started where you are, with an interest in SQL and I.T. topics, a passion to learn more, but also with the desire to share what they know with their peers.  If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is Speaker idol. Speaker Idol is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL or otherwise, that is informative, useful and engaging.  This is a great way to get experience presenting a technical topic to the community, and a great way to find and develop the next generation of speakers!</description>

      <title>Traveling through the 4th Dimension with T-SQL and PowerBI</title>
      <description>Time. We are all cursed and blessed with it. We run out of it, often need more of it, sometimes forget it but are always keeping track of it. In this session, we will delve into the functions provided in T-SQL and PowerBI to demonstrate how to solve both simple and complex problems with time and dates for your reports and dashboards. Ever wondered what is so special about 01/01/1900 and what will happen on January 1, 10,000? Do you want to know how to find gaps in time between systems or forecast the future? Are you interested to know how to accurately tally hours from minutes (it may not be as easy as you thought), then this session will not be a waste of your time.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server</title>
      <description>It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.

      <title>Mastering Plan Guides: Tell The Query Optimizer You're The Boss</title>
      <description>It's Monday morning and everyone is complaining that the database is slow. You see the problem - even though indexes aren't fragmented and statistics are up to date the query optimizer is choosing a bad plan. Users want it fixed (now!) and you know a way to get things working again but you're not allowed to change code because...it's production. What's a good DBA going to do? Show the query optimizer that you're the boss with plan guides! In this session you'll learn what plan guide are, how they work, and when to (and not to) use them to make under-performing queries behave.</description>

      <title>TSQL Coding Techniques - Are You Playing with Fire?</title>
      <description>The good news? T-SQL is one of the easiest coding languages to learn.  The bad news? Writing scalable T-SQL that performs optimally is an art that takes years to master. In this session, learn about some common T-SQL Troublemakers - Looping, Scalar Functions, Implicit Conversions, Non-Parameterized SQL, Parameter Sniffing and Value List Handling.  Through examples and demos in this session you will witness the situational pitfalls of the techniques above.  With each demo, you will be given an alternate T-SQL solution that solves the same problem in an efficient and scalable manner.  Let's get things moving!</description>

      <description>The Column Store Index functionality released in SQL 2012 did allow for stunning performance gains for OLAP-style queries, but as a v1.0 release it suffered from a number of caveats, limitations, provisos, etc.  The one BIGGIE was that it made it's underlying table NON-UPDATABLE.  Well, that often implementation-killing restriction has been addressed, along with a huge number of other fixes and enhancements.  We will cover what those are and also see actual usage with some nice demos.</description>
