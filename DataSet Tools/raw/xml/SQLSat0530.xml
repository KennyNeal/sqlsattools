      <description>I started my education in finance.  After completing my MBA in Finance, I could not find interesting work locally.  A recruiter knew of my passion for data and statistical analysis when completing financial models.  He introduced me to the BI industry.  I immediately knew this was going to be a great fit.  I have not looked back since.  I have held a couple of roles in a corporate setting but have been consulting for three years now.  I have heavy experience in SQL development, statistical analysis, and data visualization.  I have moderate experience in data warehousing, database management, optimization, and overall data architecture and the tools that spread across that landscape.</description>

      <title>DBA 102: Now What</title>
      <description>Things happened, you got a knock on the head and when you awoke your boss said “congratulations” you are our new DBA, perhaps you came to the role in a more intentional manner or are just DBA curious.  Your environment is running but you are wondering “now what” or “what’s next”.  In this session we will give an overview of a few things that could, perhaps even should be next and give some recommendations as to where you can find more resources on-line and maybe even suggest a few sessions to attend at this very SQL Saturday.  So, what will be covered, recovery strategy (you think I mean backups, I don’t, you’ll see why), a touch on performance tuning with a hint of indexing thrown in, add a pinch of high availability and a smattering of security all of which will give you some idea how to answer “now what”.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction</title>
      <description>It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided. </description>

      <title>Learning and Optimizing the SQL Server Plan Cache</title>
      <description>SQL Server memory management is one of the most important aspects of a writing T-SQL code. And yet many of us don’t know the fundamentals beyond “SQL Server will take care of that”. In this session, we’ll go deep into the internal behavior of the plan cache. We’ll cover four main problem scenarios within the plan cache, what causes them, and how to fix them, including:

1.	Bloating – scenarios that cause SQL Server to needlessly waste space in the plan cache. 
2.	Suboptimal plans – scenarios where SQL Server can’t help but choose a bad execution plan, usually self-inflicted.
3.	Parameter sniffing – situations in which SQL Server specifically chooses a bad execution plan do to the type of parameters pass into T-SQL code.
4.	Recompiles – situations where SQL Server is unable to completely process a block of T-SQL code without having to recompile it. 

If you don’t know much about SQL Server memory management, especially if you write T-SQL code, then this session is for you! You’ll learn </description>

      <title>Why “R” you not leveraging the power of “R” in Power BI?!?</title>
      <description>R is a very powerful statistical programming language that has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years. In early 2015 Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, a major provider of software and services for R. Microsoft has since incorporated R in Azure ML, SQL Server 2016, and Power BI. 

In this session I will focus on the benefits of using R in Power BI. I will show how to leverage R for data munging (ETL) and I will also show how to leverage R to create custom visualizations. I will focus on the "Wickham stack" which is a group of very popular R packages developed by Hadley Wickham. The “Wickham stack” includes the ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr packages. I will discuss logical use cases for using R within Power BI as well as some of the pitfalls that you may run into.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2016 "Hidden Gems"</title>
      <description>By far the most important SQL Server release since the heady days of 2005, SQL Server 2016 represents a huge leap forward in a number of key areas. You've no doubt heard plenty about such features as Query Store, JSON support, Polybase, and the other big-ticket items. But there are also a number of very cool features that don't usually make the top 10 lists. In this talk you'll learn about enhancements to indexing (including both Columnstore and traditional b-tree indexes), DMVs, compression, string handling, encryption, configuration, and even timezone support. These smaller features may not be highlighted in the latest glossy ads from Microsoft's marketing department, but they're the kinds of things that add up to make your life easier. Attend this session to learn all sorts of new and different reasons to upgrade as quickly as possible.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Chartaphobia with Power BI</title>
      <description>Do reports in your organization consist mostly of giant tables of data? Perhaps you have gotten as far as adding KPI indicators or conditional highlighting to the tables. Maybe you have charts, but they are hideous and distracting. Although tables of data presented as reports are commonly found in many organizations, they may be doing you and your users a disservice. We'll discuss why cognitive psychological studies tell us that graphs and pictures are more effective at communicating trends and comparisons and how to prepare to create good data visualizations. Then we'll explore how to employ purposeful data viz designs to help users achieve their goal of making informed decisions, using a fun and useful Power BI dashboard. You'll leave with guidance on how to take boring or unreadable tables of data and turn them into useful and visually appealing reports.

      <description>While the web portal makes it easy to deploy SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, there are a number of benefits to using PowerShell to do the job. This session will introduce Azure PowerShell command-lets and how to create a basic Azure infrastructure to support a SQL Server VM. We'll include the Azure Resource Manager, how to use ARM VM templates and Custom Script Extension, and how users can modify an existing Azure Gallery template. Desired State Configuration (DSC) will be covered to complete the Azure Powershell automation toolkit, allowing attendees to automate the deployment of dozens or more SQL Server virtual machines. Finally, we will configure Availability Groups and explain their eccentricities in the Azure environment as well as how to make them work effectively.</description>

      <title>Speed Up Your SSAS Cube's Data Refresh With Dynamic Partition Processing</title>
      <description>Are you sometimes plagued with the unfortunate event of your SSAS cube refresh exceeding the scheduled maintenance window?  Maybe you simply need to update recent data to reflect a critical change during business hours, but can’t afford several hours of downtime.  I have a solution for you!  In this session, we will focus on building an ETL framework while leveraging your cube’s logical partition design to dynamically process only the necessary data within your measure group.  We will discuss audit logging, cube processing options, partition design and metadata access.  These techniques and strategies will provide a faster data refresh process for your warehouse or data mart.</description>

      <title>Performance Pitfalls from Code Reuse</title>
      <description>Have you ever found yourself deconstructing endless layers of nested code? Is your T-SQL codebase written in an object-oriented format with functions  views?  Did you know that object-oriented code reuse can come at a significant penalty?  

Come to this session and learn why applying object-oriented principles can be extremely detrimental to your T-SQL's performance. You will learn how T-SQL is not like other common programming languages. We will peek inside the Query Optimizer to see how it handles these scenarios. Through extensive demos, we will explore solutions to maximize performance. You will be introduced to a T-SQL tool that will aid you in unraveling nested code. Alternate design patterns will be shown to help you mitigate these performance pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</title>
      <description>Abstract: As a beginner database professional, execution plans are intimidating. In this 1 hour session, I will take you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drill into key operators, warnings and properties.
Prerequisites: Basic understanding of T-SQL and the SQL Server Engine.
Sections:
•	You will understand how, why and when the execution plan will be created and saved to plan cache.
•	Reading the execution plan will be much less intimidating as you can talk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. 
•	After looking at the key operators you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, the operator properties and identify common performance issues and tuning opportunities.
•	Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan, save it for later analysis and comparison after modifications have occurred.

      <title>TempDB Done Right</title>
      <description>Every SQL Server instance relies on the tempdb database. Whether through explicit use with #temp tables or @table variables, or implicit use through working space for many other operations, most tempdb databases get quite a workout. There are additional concerns when using Always On Availability Groups. This session will dig into many of the otherwise-hidden issues that can kill server performance. Attend this session and you will be able to spot tempdb performance issues, drill into the causes, and take the steps necessary to solve them.</description>

      <description>Microsoft Power BI is going great places. Its great visualizations, easy-to-use tools, and robust sharing capabilities are improving with new releases almost every time you turn around. But, what if uploading or storing your company's data in the cloud is a potential deal-breaker? Fortunately, the Microsoft Power BI Gateway - Enterprise make it possible to live query data in an on-premises SSAS instance for display in Power BI. In this session, we will go through what this gateway does, how it works, and how it is installed to show that BI in the cloud doesn't require data in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Data Architecture 101</title>
      <description>This presentation is a quick introduction for the DBA or developer who was just told that their boss promised a major new customer a scalable, well designed database. The customer will pay a lot of cash and years of ongoing business using this database… If you deliver it this week!

You’ll get a big bonus if you build this right, but you also remember what your co-workers did to the person who bungled the last database design… and wonder if that designer ever recovered! This session will introduce you to the fundamentals of Datatypes, Relational Algebra, and Normalization to help you avoid the major pitfalls and maybe get some sleep too!

This presentation is a survey of Data Architecture for the Intermediate DBA, it is not intended for experienced Data Modelers.</description>

      <description>As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.</description>

      <title>ORMs… can’t live with ‘em, can’t kill ‘em.</title>
      <description>Object-relational mappers enable developers to work with relational databases like Microsoft SQL using the languages they know and love.  Sometimes that means that the developers don’t know the underlying queries and statements being sent to the database.  This doesn’t mean that the developers don’t love SQL.  It just means that they don’t know it yet.

In this session, we’ll look at the latest builds of Microsoft’s Entity Framework and see what programming tools developers use to work with SQL databases.  We’ll also take a look at Sequelize.  Sequelize is an open source ORM written in JavaScript for Node.js.  

We’ll take a look at code first development, advanced querying techniques, connecting to existing databases and migrations.  We’ll also take a look at lazy and eager loading techniques.  We’ll take a look at these two ORM’s from the eyes of the developer and the DBA.</description>

      <title>Wait Statistics - The Top 5 Waits You Should Know</title>
      <description>Wait statistics are a great tool for troubleshooting performance problems in SQL Server. However, there are so many different wait types in SQL Server, it can be challenging to determine what to focus on and what can be ignored. Even after discovering that SQL Server is waiting for something, most DBAs don't know where to look next. In this session, we'll examine 5 of the most frequently seen wait types in SQL Server and how to troubleshoot each of them. You'll learn how to determine the root cause of a particular wait type, and how to avoid common mistakes made when troubleshooting with wait statistics. </description>

      <description>Attendees will learn Power BI’s administrative features providing security and best practice methods for development and deployment. As Power BI does not use network security, the importance in things like Group Workspaces to ensure visualizations aren’t lost when people leave the organization are discussed. Practices to increase scalability over time are reviewed.  Development of content packs are explored to increase adoption of Power BI while establishing data access standards using scheduled refreshes with gateways. Licensing strategies and use of One Drives and their impact on update strategies are also reviewed.
Without any guidelines, many organizations proliferate data models over time leading to complaints about data accuracy as updates can be random. Learn processes for the use of gateways and their role to prevent rampant data model and create the ability to maintain the quality of the visualizations over time to provide a usable data framework for Power BI.

      <title>How to Speak Australian: Oracle for the SQL Server Developer</title>
      <description>Even in the career of a SQL Server and/or MSBI expert, you will undoubtedly encounter Oracle databases – most often as source systems or data migrations.  While the underlying structures and languages are mostly similar, there are a few differences which can be stumping.  We’ll highlight some differences, including:	Connecting to Oracle, Databases and schemata, object naming, and differences between T-SQL and PL/SQL, and tool selection.

      <title>Scalable Application Design with Service Broker</title>
      <description>How your business applications interact directly with the corporate database can dramatically affect how successful you are. One of the biggest issues is performance with large databases. By designing the application to use asynchronous messaging for non-critical updates, you can focus performance concerns  where the timeliness is critical. SQL Server Service Broker handles the asynchronous requests quickly and efficiently and minimizes conflicts with your critical updates. This session walks you through the steps to get Service Broker running and providing a consistent delivery of your business data.</description>
