      <description>I#39;m a DBA who has gone through most of my career with few people to learn and unsure of where to find great help until I found a real mentor.  When I started at a company with a great, knowledgeable manager and learned to find others speaking about SQL Server online my skills boomed.  This is especially true in my most passionate area, SQL Server performance.  

Knowing that my knowledge came from others, I now have a second passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</description>

      <title>Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery</title>
      <description>I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.</description>

      <title>Leaving the Past Behind: Rewriting Your Checklist for SQL 2016</title>
      <description>How big should the page file be for Windows Server 2016? How many data files should SQL Server 2016's TempDB contain? What trace flags should we use by default now?
 
These are questions you addressed long ago in your setup checklist. You've spent a lot of time with that checklist, and you're sure it's perfect. Or is it? When was the last time you visited that checklist?  Does it make sense for SQL 2014? What about SQL 2016? Change is hard, and DBAs need to constantly challenge yesterday's best practices to ensure they meet today's business needs.
 
Join Microsoft MVP Mike Hillwig and his list of server administration best practices that need to be revisited for modern versions of SQL Server, especially SQL 2016.</description>

      <title>Statistics  Cardinality – How they work to find data efficiently</title>
      <description>Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.

      <title>The Secret to High Performance Code...The Devil’s in the Data</title>
      <description>You found code you need in a “Holy Grail” article complete with test data and tests across several methods “clearly” identifying the best one to use.  Excited at your good fortune, you quickly download the code, rerun the tests on your Dev box . It “passes” with flying colors.  You promote the code to production and go home on time for a change.
The next day, your boss and the DBA are waiting for you in your cube and, look, the DBA has a bat with your name on it because your code brought the server to its knees and the code failed.
How is that possible?  The answer is, “The Devil’s in the Data”.
Whether you’re an SQL “Newbie” or seasoned veteran, this “Black Arts” session will teach you most of what you need to know to build large quantities of just about any test data you might imagine and more quickly than you ever dreamed.  It’ll also show you how to avoid the pitfalls that lead to the DBA with the bat. ;</description>

      <title>A Discussion on the Azure SQL Database Security for the Cloud Objectionist</title>
      <description>This session is for the those who have security objections related to moving to the cloud or are interested in the security features of the of the Azure SQL Database, a relational database Platform as a Service offering in Microsoft Azure.  There certainly are Azure SQL Database features which have parity with SQL Server engine features (Always Encrypted, TDE, RLS, etc.).  But this session will take a look at security features focused on the Azure SQL Database; server firewall settings, Auditing  Threat detection,  Alert Rules, Role-based Access Control and configuring Azure AD Authentication.  If time permits, we will step through Dynamic Data Making via the Azure portal.  Hopefully the main take away will be a warm and fuzzy (and more secure) feeling about planning for cloud workloads.</description>

      <title>Working with SSRS Data-Driven Subscriptions </title>
      <description>SSRS Subscriptions are one of the great things within SSRS to automate delivery of reports.  However, one of the more powerful methods of further enhancing this automation is by use of data-driven subscriptions.  Data-driven subscriptions allow us to determine at run time what subscribers and other parameters can be used for automating the generation of these reports.

We#39;ll begin with a quick overview of what the more familiar subscription functionality is and then quickly jump into what data-driven subscriptions provide for us.  We#39;ll then demonstrate from beginning to end how to implement data-driven-subscriptions.  Lastly, we#39;ll wrap up with any tips and tricks to enhance our process.</description>

      <title>Winning with Columnstore - A Customer Story</title>
      <description>This session will feature a real story of a customer who was running into performance and scaling issues on a big iron Oracle RAC system and why they decided to consider the magic of the Column Store for this situation.  Discussion will focus on the existing environments for testing both SQL 2016 and Oracle as well as the methodologies used for testing.  We will examine the decisions made for choosing indexes (both traditional and column store) for the main tables in the data warehouse as well as the partitioning strategies employed.  We will wrap up the discussion with the results of the testing and where they are now.</description>

      <title>Exploiting SQL Server Security Holes</title>
      <description>Most flaws in SQL Server can be avoided with proper security policies ... as long as those policies are followed. What can happen if they are not followed or security is very loose? A lot of people will tell you what not to do, but has anyone ever shown you what can happen if you do them anyway?

This demo heavy session will show you just what I could do in these situations if I was so inclined to exploit these lapses in security. You will learn how to prevent these security holes to ensure you are protected.</description>

      <title>Designing SQL Server HA/DR Infrastructure to meet the SLA</title>
      <description>Once you agreed to an SLA for the databases you manage its time to deliver on this promise
This session will show how to select from the many HA/DR features you have in SQL Server to pick the ones that will help you meet the SLA and most important will tell you how you must combine them to be successful.
For each one of the solutions we discuss we will define a series of failure modes and then check if the solution actually can fulfill the SLA as promised or if it needs more</description>

      <description>Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</description>

      <description>How much do you really understand how your workload changes based on the time of day, background processing, user load, or which application module is in use? There's no better way to understand your workload than to benchmark and replay it. This will help you mitigate risk in production before making changes, allow you to find and improve bottlenecks in your code or infrastructure. In this session, you will learn how to compare and replay your own workload and synthetic TPC-C workloads in your environment to make you look like a rockstar.</description>

      <title>Getting to know U-SQL</title>
      <description>With so many languages around to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize data, Microsoft introduced yet another language : U-SQL.  In this session, we'll take a look at what U-SQL is, what it brings to the table, and how it differs from (or overlaps with) the existing constructs (T-SQL, SQL CLR, DAX/MDX, PowerQuery/M, R etc.,).  We'll go over step-by-step in getting started with U-SQL, and review some use case scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Pros and Cons of Table Partitioning</title>
      <description>Have you considered implementing SQL Server partitioning? According to Wikipedia, “A partition is a division of a logical database or its constituent elements into distinct independent parts. Database partitioning is normally done for manageability, performance or availability reasons, as for load balancing”.  Would you benefit from it or will it be a big headache for you?   In a very straight forward approach, I will introduce what, when, why and how to create partition.</description>

      <title>Stretch Database and Managed Backups: Cloud Services for your SQL Servers</title>
      <description>Utilizing Azure cloud services does not mean moving all of your data or control away from your on-premises SQL Servers.  In this session we will cover the new SQL 2016 Stretch Database and the SQL 2014 Managed Backups to Azure features.  We will look at use-cases and limitations of both features to illustrate how these cloud services may fit into your current SQL Server environment.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Transactional Replication: A Deep Dive</title>
      <description>Ah, SQL Server Transactional Replication. The technology everyone loves to hate. But for all the notoriety, there's some interesting technology to be had in it that might you might want to leverage. In this session, we'll explore what happens when you create a new transactional publication: what happens during a snapshot, how data gets delivered to subscribers, and how you can monitor, tweak, and tune your publications. We'll also see some common trouble spots and how to identify them. There will be plenty of examples and demos and, yes, even some PowerShell!</description>
