      <title>Azure, PowerShell, and SQL Server Virtual Machines</title>
      <description>While the web portal makes it easy to deploy SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, there are a number of benefits to using PowerShell to do the job. This session will introduce Azure PowerShell command-lets and how to create a basic Azure infrastructure to support a SQL Server VM. We'll include the Azure Resource Manager, how to use ARM VM templates and Custom Script Extension, and how users can modify an existing Azure Gallery template. Desired State Configuration (DSC) will be covered to complete the Azure Powershell automation toolkit, allowing attendees to automate the deployment of dozens or more SQL Server virtual machines. Finally, we will configure Availability Groups and explain their eccentricities in the Azure environment as well as how to make them work effectively.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Power BI:  Working with Data Sources</title>
      <description>Power BI (either Desktop or the service) supports a wide (and growing) range of data sources.  From the sources with which most IT pros and data analysts are regularly involved (relational and OLAP databases, text and similar files, etc.) to sources that are a little more out of the ordinary for some of us (OData, MS Exchange, Active Directory, and a growing list of others), these reservoirs and suppliers of data grow increasingly more valuable in self-service BI.  
In this session, BI Architect, SQL Server MVP and Analysis Services Maestro Bill Pearson focuses upon the first step in working with data sources in Power BI:  connecting to, and extracting data from, a diverse range of data sources. Throughout the session, we explore various sources and witness how to employ Power BI with each.

      <title>Revenge: The SQL!</title>
      <description>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</description>

      <title>Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros</title>
      <description>Finding any IT industry publication that does not frequently reference Hadoop and Big Data is nearly impossible. Even so, to many SQL Server professionals it remains a mystery. 'Introducing Hadoop to SQL Server Pros' is designed to bridge the gap between knowledge of SQL Server and an understanding of Hadoop by comparing similarities in key functionality. Equally important is understanding how Hadoop is different and the use cases in which it compliments SQL Server. Of special note are the ways Microsoft is integrating Hadoop in its data strategy and related products. Perhaps 2016, Hadoop's 10th birthday year, is the time for SQL Server Pros to become familiar with this platform and how to prepare for it's introduction into our work as data professionals.</description>

      <title>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</title>
      <description>For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.</description>

      <title>How Queries Work</title>
      <description>If you've been writing T-SQL code for a while, but have never delved into what happens after you submit your queries there is a whole world that you are missing. Taking the next step as a T-SQL developer requires understanding the basics of the SQL Server architecture and what it means to use a declarative language. Have you ever wondered why cursors are so slow, why query performance can be unpredictable, or how you can begin to analyze your queries more deeply? In this session we will cover what SQL Server has to do to turn your T-SQL code into the results you expect and how you can use this knowledge to make your code better.</description>

With more than 5000 packages all machine learning algorithms are covered and improving. R packages help you prepare the data, e.g.: packages for cross validation with N folds, build machine learning models, validation, create plots and to generate predictions. SQL Server 2016 and R Server are a perfect match for building enterprise grade solutions that support deployments for real time predictions and continuous model updates. Join this session for an overview based on sample cases about how to build enterprise grade machine learning solutions with SQL Server and R.</description>

      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>

      <description>What if you could import 25 million rows of CSV data in less than 2 minutes? Or regain lost sysadmin access to your SQL Server in 20 seconds?  Need to check which of your 200 servers has misconfigured max memory, calculate the proper memory and then set it? No problem, couple of minutes, tops.

PowerShell can do amazing things for database administrators. It can automate your complex, onerous tasks.  It can also automate the boring yet vital tasks like testing backups, and it can do it faster than you think.  Even better, it is easier to learn than you might expect.

Get Better, Faster, Stronger with PowerShell  SQL Server.</description>

      <description>PowerShell is everywhere, and that includes SQL Server. In this session we'll look at using PowerShell with both the SQL Server provider and the SMO (SQL Management Objects) library. Learn how to handle common DBA tasks, such as backups, reviewing error logs, and checking the status of SQL Jobs. 

You'll also see how to perform developer tasks such as creating tables, inserting records, and querying data. Perhaps most importantly, you will learn how to read and understand the SMO object model, and translate it into PowerShell commands. Come see how to make your SQL Server Pop with PowerShell.

      <title>Using SQL to Avoid the SharePoint List Threshold</title>
      <description>What do you do when your SharePoint list exceeds the 5,000 item threshold? Do you turn off throttling for the list? Do you increase the limit in Central Admin? If either of these are your solution, you're risking a SQL database lockup, which could affect more than the one list. Based on a real world scenario, this session will share how a major healthcare institution recently used a SQL view containing 6,000+ items to avoid SharePoint's list threshold. Additionally, attendees will see how a Power View report built in SharePoint used the same SQL data to provide an interactive dashboard for data monitoring.</description>

      <description>How much Azure can you Azure? How many cloud can you cloud? Hear the lessons learned from an attempt at an “All Azure” BI Project.
