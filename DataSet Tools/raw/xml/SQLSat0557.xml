      <title>Does it Hurt When I Do This? Performing a SQL Server Health Check</title>
      <description>How often do you review your SQL Servers for basic security, maintenance, and performance issues?  Many of the servers I "inherit" as a managed services provider have quite a few gaping holes. It is not unusual to find databases that are never backed up, servers with constant login failures (is it an attack or a bad connection string?), and servers that need more RAM/CPU/etc. (or sometimes that even have too much!) 

Come learn how to use freely available tools from multiple layers of the SQL Server stack to check your servers for basic issues like missing backups and CheckDB as well as for more advanced issues like page life expectancy problems and improper indexing. If you are responsible in any way for a Microsoft SQL Server (DBA, Windows Admin, even a Developer) you will see value in this session!</description>

      <title>The Lost Science of Set Theory</title>
      <description>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.</description>

      <title>Automated Restore Script Output for Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution</title>
      <description>This session is designed to be useful to two different audiences:
1.Those implementing Ola Hallengren’s Maintenance Solution for the first time. (Or don't even know what the Maintenance Solution is!)
2.Those that have been using it for awhile, but might have a hole in their DR plan – what to restore when a resource goes offline.

We will do an overview of the maintenance solution to start, then get down and dirty with the guts of the extension. What I am presenting is a custom extension that works out of the box for jobs created using the maintenance solution. The scripts will add an additional job step to all DatabaseBackup jobs which will output a text file that contains the most current restore scripts for each database in the instance.
If you don't know what I just described in that last paragraph, you should come to this session and that will be explained as well!

      <title>Virtual SQL Servers. Actual Performance.</title>
      <description>Virtualizing your business-critical SQL Servers should not imply that they will run slower than if they were physical. When properly architected and managed, virtual SQL Servers should be equally as fast as their physical counterparts, if not faster. However, if not properly constructed, silent and seemingly random performance killers can strike and significantly hurt your database performance. 
This session is packed with many tips and tricks gained from years of experience for getting the most performance from your virtual SQL Servers. The major roadblocks to performance will be discussed and the knowledge gained will help you work with your infrastructure engineers so you can optimize the system stack for performance. Tools, techniques, and processes will be demonstrated to help you measure and validate the system performance of the key components underneath your data.</description>

      <description>How many times has a lack of budget for hardware, training, or expert assistance caused problems for you in designing, implementing, and maintaining a great SQL Server environment?  Come to this session to learn effective ways to secure the budget you need instead of being consistently required to do more with less, or worse – nothing.  The good news is that there are several simple and practical things you can do to vastly improve your ability to get the budget you need when you need it.  You will hear how to think like an executive from someone who was one for many years so you can begin to influence decisions at the right level to get what both you and your SQL Server infrastructure need.  </description>

      <title>Accelerating DevOps Using Data Virtualization</title>
      <description>DevOps is the melding of application development, testing, and IT operations. All tasks from infrastructure to coding to testing to transition into production must be automated so that new features and fixes can be continuously delivered.

Constraining DevOps is data. Databases and applications have grown enormous and complex. quot;Storage is cheapquot; is a lie. Provisioning a full environment for each developer or tester on each task of each project appears unrealistic, when each might require several terabytes of storage. And so everyone is limited to working in a small handful of shared environments that are refreshed only every few months, and code quality suffers.

Data virtualization is the solution. Virtual databases and file-systems only consume space from deltas, so it is possible to provision multiple terabytes for megabytes. Coders and testers have full environments fast in which to develop and test, improving code quality.  Learn about the technical details behind this solutio</description>

      <title>Consumption Based Architecture and MSBI</title>
      <description>As the tools available for BI and data warehousing continue to improve, it should change the way we ultimately deliver BI solutions. Microsoft#39;s BI solutions help us keep data closer to the source. As data and BI architects, we need to design solutions that can support this model. Consumption Based Architecture is one such architecture. The goal of this architecture is to plan and design solutions that minimize ongoing maintenance and enable users quicker and more complete access to data. Some highlights are how tabular models and PowerPivot support this process and where does MDM for BI fit in. Ready to discuss the quot;death of enterprise data warehousesquot;?

      <title>Level Up Your Biml: Best Practices and Coding Techniques</title>
      <description>Is your Biml solution starting to remind you of a bowl of tangled spaghetti code? Good! That means you are solving real problems while saving a lot of time. The next step is to make sure that your solution does not grow too complex and confusing - you do not want to waste all that saved time on future maintenance!

Attend this session for an overview of Biml best practices and coding techniques. Learn how to centralize and reuse code with include files and the CallBimlScript method. Make your code easier to read and write by utilizing LINQ (Language-Integrated Queries). Share code between files by using Annotations and ObjectTags. And finally, if standard Biml is not enough to solve your problems, you can create your own C# helper classes and extension methods to implement custom logic.

Start improving your code today and level up your Biml in no time!</description>

      <title>It#39;s Elastic! Boogie Woogie Woogie!</title>
      <description>Azure SQL Database provides fantastic scalability and flexibility for your data tier. You can scale it up with ease when you need more power and scale it down again when load returns to normal. With the pay as you go model, you pay for each database based on performance characteristics. But when you have a scaled out architecture of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of databases, how can you keep costs from spiraling out of control? How can you query across all of those databases? How can you MANAGE so many databases? How can you write your application to make the right decisions about where to put which data? This session will introduce you to four key pieces of this overall story: Elastic Database Pools, Elastic Query, Elastic Database Jobs, and the Elastic Database Tools .Net library. With these tools, you take your Azure SQL Database data tier to the next level of scale and manageability.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Hybrid Cloud Strategy: Best Of Both Worlds With On-Prem + Cloud</title>
      <description>For years it seemed that the only message SQL Server professionals were hearing was quot;to the Cloud.... you must get to the Cloud!quot;. However, if you work in a highly regulated industry, or one simply averse to change, this likely was not an option for you. The good news is, Microsoft heard your feedback and has been busy incorporating Cloud connectivity, compatibility, and functionality into the box product.

Come spend the hour with me and you’ll learn how to leverage the power of the Cloud with your on-premises SQL Server install. We’ll cover backup and restore options with Windows Azure Storage, using Windows Azure VMs for high availability, how to store your data files in Windows Azure Storage, and more.  We’ll start with SQL Server 2012 and work our way up to the most recently released bits for SQL Server 2016.  You can have the best of both worlds with a SQL Server Hybrid Cloud strategy!</description>

      <title>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</title>
      <description>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We#39;ll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn#39;t do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.</description>

      <title>Managing SQL Server Performance with Extended Events</title>
      <description>One of a DBA#39;s primary responsibilities is managing the performance of a SQL Server environment. When performance problems arise, DBAs need to have the correct tools in place to be able to dig in and discover the issues that are occurring.
