      <title>SQL Server 2016: A dive into Data Quality Services</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016: Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.</description>

      <title>Dive into the Query Optimizer - Undocumented Insight</title>
      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>Query Processing in In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton)</title>
      <description>In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.</description>

      <title>Getting started with Azure SQL Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>As data warehouses continue to see rapid expansions of data, traditional architectures struggle to keep up. Massively Parallel Processing is a technique that allows a data warehouse to be seamlessly distributed across multiple machines allowing for near linear scaling. Massively Parallel processing was first introduced to SQL through Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW) which was a large and often expensive deployment process. Azure SQL Data Warehouse brings much of the Power of Parallel Data Warehouse but with many advantages of the cloud such as lower costs and faster deployment.
In this session we will look at how the Azure SQL Data Warehouse works behind the scenes. We will also look at various options for provisioning and loading data before ending with a look at how queries executed.</description>

      <title>The language informally known as M</title>
      <description>At the heart of Power BI is the Power Query Formula Language (informally known as M), a dynamically typed, case-sensitive functional language for creating mashup queries, similar to the F# language.

Although Power BI Desktop has a number of great UI features for transformations, under the hood it's all M, and the better you understand the language, the more you can take advantage of the capabilities inherent in Power BI.

In this session I will introduce you to the basics of the M language and demonstrate some of the more advanced features.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Operational Analytics</title>
      <description>It used to be that if you want to do analysis of data that is stored in SQL Server, you had to extract the data into a data ware-house or something similar, and run you analysis there. The downside with that is the time it takes from the time of insertion into the transaction store until the data is available in the DW. In this session we will see how we can use SQL Server 2016 to do real time analytics against your OLTP database.</description>

      <title>From Me BI to We BI, take your BI solution beyond the clouds</title>
      <description>ne of the main challenges organizations face in the BI world is to allow, via a single platform, contradicting needs of self-service BI with governance and Enterprise scale.
Come and see the game changing approach of Pyramid Analytics that allows organizations to obtain these impossible needs of business users and IT in a singular BI platform.
Pyramid Analytics the platform that Microsoft selected as a strategic partner for PowerBI.
 
Pyramid Analytics revolutionary platform provides a single platform that delivers:
•             Self Service – No code necessary.
•             Web based central administration and security.
•             Role based functionality for different roles in the organization (Professional, Analyst and Consumer).
•             Universal configuration – build once use anywhere (PC, Tablet and Mobile).
•             Enterprise scale – parallel processing, clustering and load balancing.
•             And more ….</description>

      <title>So, when you say database what do you mean?</title>
      <description>These days when you say "database server" it could really mean many things.

For something like SQL server there are so many options: on-premise server, off-premise server. On-premise server with off-premise data. Then there are the various  Azure offerings with fancy names like Azure SQL, Data Lake, Hadoop.

You also get graph databases and document databases.

This session will cover some of the more popular types of data stores that are available today and we will look at their use cases. While SQL server is great for many things, one has to be aware of the other options that are available out there.</description>

      <title>What R You Analyzing</title>
      <description>R has become one of the leading analysis tools for developers and data scientists alike. However, in order for R to do its magic it needs data so historically we have imported data from various sources, SQL Server being one of those sources. In SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has embedded R in the SQL engine. Yes, we do now have access to R natively in SQL Server.

In this session we will look at how R works in SQL Server, and also talk about some performance improvements you are getting by running R in SQL Server. </description>

This is a non-technical session that will give an overview of how your data landscape is changing and what you need to be aware of  to derive value from data.</description>

We'll investigate what makes an index useful to SQL Server and what common mistakes make indexes useless. We'll go into the details of how various query predicates interact with indexes and what the primary driver is when designing indexes for any database application.

This session is aimed at people who are relatively new to indexing.</description>

      <title>On Transactions and Atomic Operations</title>
      <description>If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, do, it's not use enough transactions.

Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code

In this session, we'll look at what transactions are and why we should use them. We'll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We'll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we'll see why nested transactions are a lie.

      <description>When an ETL is initially deployed it is expected to run for a certain amount of time based on testing during development. It does not always come to our attention that the duration the ETL takes to complete starts growing at an abnormal rate. Using Simple Linear Regression, we can detect the duration anomalies of ETLs. Will be going into detail on what Simple Linear Regression is and how you can use it to your advantage to detect ETL duration anomalies.</description>
