      <title>Protecting your data from SQL Injection attacks</title>
      <description>Kevin will be talking on the topic of SQL injection - something that all of us need to be aware of and protect against. 

And here is a blurb from:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection

" The best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to injection is to verify that all use of interpreters clearly separates untrusted data from the command or query. For SQL calls, this means using bind variables in all prepared statements and stored procedures, and avoiding dynamic queries. 
Checking the code is a fast and accurate way to see if the application uses interpreters safely. Code analysis tools can help a security analyst find the use of interpreters and trace the data flow through the application. Penetration testers can validate these issues by crafting exploits that confirm the vulnerability."

Kevin will give us a demo that will show an injection attack in action and how to mitigate it.</description>

      <title>R; One Ring to Rule Them All</title>
      <description>R is one of the most popular and powerful analytics languages. That helps data scientists to prepare data, predict data, and visualize it. Microsoft offers several deployment options to bring next-generation advanced analytics to your business. Microsoft R Server delivers R-based analytics to where your data lives. Processing analytics in-place eliminates data movement, reducing latencies and operational costs. 

In this session, first basic concepts of machine learning will be discussed. Then, a demo of how to use R for data cleaning, visualization, and prediction will be presented. Subsequently, an introduction to use R server and R in SQL Server 2016 will be shown. Finally, a brief introduction on how to use Azure ML with R will be shown.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Query Store</title>
      <description>Query store is an awesome new feature in SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database that allows you to store the history of query plans (what SQL Server turns your SQL statement into), including detailed data on performance, making comparison with previous versions of a statement easy. 

The Query Store also lets you identify queries that may degrade performance over time and make necessary adjustments.
I#39;ll show how easy it is to work with the Query Store and work with query plans.</description>

      <title>Temporal Databases in Microsoft SQL server 2016</title>
      <description>Introducing Temporal Databases in SQL Server 2016

More and more organizations are storing archives of data to help them make important business decisions. Traditionally, organizations had to rely on expensive, and tedious methods to go back in time and make sense of growth, negative growth, profit, loss, etc.

Microsoft SQL Server 2016 introduces a new feature called Temporal Databases which essentially solves all the problems mentioned above.

This presentation aims to go deep into Temporal Databases (requirements, use cases, technical know-hows) and present some demo’s in order to gain specific understanding on this new feature which is being called “Time Travel”.</description>
