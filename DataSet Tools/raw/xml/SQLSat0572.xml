      <title>Mobile, Paginated, KPIs, and Power BI, Oh My! SSRS 2016 Reporting</title>
      <description>SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2016 is getting the biggest update since SQL Server 2005! This session will define and demo each of the SSRS report types are and how they are developed and supported: Mobile (previously DataZen reports), Paginated (SSRS RDL reports), KPIs (new standalone Key Performance Indicators), and Power BI (now Power BI can be managed in SSRS for an on-premises solution). All of these report types can now be managed in SSRS for a single reporting solution.

We will also look at the new SSRS Web Portal (replacement for Report Manager) and how the development environment will change as well. Sometime will also be spent on how to support all of these report types and the impact it will have on IT.
If you have been curious about what has changed with SSRS in SQL Server 2016 and you want to be ahead of the curve, this is the session for you!</description>

      <title>Execution Plans for Mere Mortals</title>
      <description>For beginning database professionals, execution plans can be intimidating. This 1-hour session takes you through the basics of reading graphical execution plans and drills into key operators, warnings, and properties. Learn how, why, and when an execution plan is created and saved to plan cache. 

Reading execution plans becomes much less intimidating as we walk through the flow and process of a graphical execution plan. After looking at the key operators, you will be able to analyze the operators of your execution plans, view the operator properties, and identify common performance-tuning opportunities. Finally, you will be able to capture the execution plan and save it for analysis and comparison after modifications.</description>

      <title>New SQL Server 2016 Feature: "Query Store"</title>
      <description>Do you have  any SQL Server monitoring tool in your production environment?
If so, what would you do when you find a trouble-making query?
Do you write a request to software developers to tune it?

In SQL Server 2016 you have an option not only monitor worst performing queries, but also decide how they have to be executed in your system. You can look at different query plans and force SQL Server to use the quickest one or one which uses less memory or IO.

During that session we will go through major new features of SQL Server 2016 and nail down the "Query Store".

You will learn about that new SQL Server feature and maybe you find how it would  help you in your current production environment.</description>

      <title>Making Row Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking work for you!</title>
      <description>Security by design, it is how we should be building data platforms and applications. Security is not an afterthought that should be tacked on. With Azure SQL DB and SQL Server 2016, this got a lot easier with the new security features that have been added, notably Dynamic Data Masking and Row Level Security.

Here we will explore these two new tools that have been added to our toolbox of SQL Server security. Looking to understand what the features are, and how they work. More importantly, we will look at the use cases for these features. When they are, and are not appropriate. Finally looking at how we can incorporate them into the systems that we are building, and whether we can design them into our existing systems.

Understanding the capabilities that we have available is important, as the threats change so must the technology and our approach. By the end of this session, you will be in a position to decide if these capabilities will help you secure the data you manage.</description>

      <title>Analysing your online presence using Power BI</title>
      <description>In this session we will look at how you can use Power BI to analyse you company’s online presence. 

We will look at how you can source data from Google Analytics, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and finally from web pages. We will then show how you can work with the data to get some meaningful analysis from it and ask the question: Can you get a holistic view of your online presence?

This is a demo rich session where we will go through getting the data in and looking through how we can extend the model using DAX to get more insight before visualizing the results. 

The participants will leave the session with ideas on how they can use Power BI (or indeed some other BI tool) to start analyzing their company#39;s online presence plus the pbix file used in the session with all the code.</description>

      <title>Real World In-Memory OLTP 2016</title>
      <description>In-Memory OLTP was a fascinating feature addition for performance nerds in 2014, but real world use has been somewhat low.  With the release of SQL Server 2016, it might be time for a second look.

An impressive list of improvements to In-Memory OLTP have changed the original release from a somewhat edge case solution to a practical consideration for an increasingly larger number of scenarios.

In this demo heavy session, we will implement and benchmark three real world use cases for memory optimized objects while showcasing In-Memory OLTP features new to SQL Server 2016.  

Many presentations, books, and deep dives describe the internals of In-Memory OLTP objects.  The focus of this course is real world implementation and best practice.</description>

      <title>Azure Machine Learning: From Design to Integration</title>
      <description>Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science concerned with systems that learn from data. So this isn’t about systems that follow explicitly programmed instructions, but rather about systems that find patterns and trends within datasets, and use them to deliver insight and predictions.

In this session, you will learn how an Azure Machine Learning solution comes to life: From the creation of a workspace, to the preparation of data, to experimentation with Machine Learning algorithms, and then finally to the integration and embedding of predictive insights into applications.

This session has been specifically designed to describe Machine Learning fundamentals, and to help enable and inspire existing data professionals taking their first steps to leverage cloud-based predictive models delivered with Azure Machine Learning. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the relative ease by which it can be accomplished.</description>

      <description>With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting  Services is finally getting some love!  In this session you will get a brief peek at some of the new features and functionality including a look at the new Report Manager interface and the new control we have over the parameter placement on screen. 
We will then dive into how to use a custom report, based on the ReportServer database transaction log table, to see which reports are actually being used and use that report to determine a smart strategy for which reports to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  You will see how to combine this understanding of active reports with the power of linked reports to simplify your Reporting Services implementation as you convert to SQL Server 2016. 
The session will conclude with a look at my “Ultimate Footer”, which you can use on any version of Reporting Services, that shows report utilization, performance details, stored procedures and data sets used and discover any inline TSQL being abused.</description>

      <title>Inside the SQLPS PowerShell Module</title>
      <description>SQLPS has been evolving since 2012 and the SQL Provider/cmdlets have been around since 2008. Have you taken advantage of the PowerShell infrastructure that is on your servers? This session takes you behind the scenes of the SQLPS module that is installed with the tools. We will cover how to get it without the tools, how to use it once you have it and why you will want to use it for simple tasks or complex ones. When you learn how to navigate SQL Server and all its services using Paths, you won't go back. Join me for a fun filled hour and learn how to keep SQLPS from becoming frustrating and a black box. You will be glad you did. Let's continue the journey to becoming a PowerShell DBA.</description>

      <title>Why Should I Care About ... Partitioned Views?</title>
      <description>Partitioned tables are awesome and partitioned views are dead, right? Well, sure partitioned views are not sexy but there are still plenty of applications where they are critical. And not necessarily just for standard edition. If your data is time stamped, do you see different queries run against older data than new data? Do you with you could segment your data across multiple columns? Do you have data you need to partition horizontally? It's possible partitioned views may still be for you. Come hear why this is still an important topic long after cargo pants and trucker hats went away.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Common Query Performance Problems with Execution Plans</title>
      <description>Ever scratched your head in bemusement at how an apparently 'simple' T-SQL query could perform so poorly or erratically? SQL Server's execution plan for the query will likely reveal the root cause. It will tell you exactly which tables and indexes SQL Server accessed, and what operations it performed, in order to return the data that your query needed.
If your query logic confused the optimizer, or if it had inaccurate statistical knowledge of the data, then prepare for some nasty surprises in the plan, such as expensive scans, sort and join operations that spill to disk, and more. We'll examine common causes of these problems, such as use of 'generic' SQL, parameter sniffing, stale statistics, and misuse of functions. We'll cover techniques that will allow you to locate quickly the execution plans for high-cost queries in the workload, and we'll use some of the new execution plan features in SQL Server 2016 to detect and diagnose more easily the underlying query performance issues.</description>

This will cut down on time and effort while responding to Production issues.

First part of the email shares some key observations about SQL Server performance which can be the key to quick resolution of the issue. Rest of the email shows different set of stats regarding CPU/Disk IO/Disk Space/Memory/Network/Blocking and database performance which could lead to the slowness observed in the application.

      <title>In memory OLTP  - what can it do for me?</title>
      <description>In Memory OLTP came along in SQL Server 2014 along with several limitations.
It was still really useful – as long as your use case suited the limitations.
SQL Server 2016 removes several of these limitations and widens the use cases of in-memory OLTP.
For example, even if you are not taking advantage of in-memory tables, you can probably leverage performance improvements by replacing traditional table variables and both local and global temporary tables with in memory implementations. Now you’ll be able to say that table variable is truly in memory!
Come along to this session and learn about some of features of in memory OLTP  - or Hekaton as a lot of people refer to this -  and how you may be able to leverage these high performance features in both new and existing applications.</description>

      <title>Keeping your SQL Objects Safe In Development</title>
      <description>It has been a long established practice to keep maintain application code in version control. Versioning your application code allows you to view changes made by several developers working on the same project. It allows the team to get the latest changes in a consistent and reliable manner. It allows you to return your code to a prior state. It even acts as a safety net for when that day comes when your developer’s computer won’t turn on.

So, what about your SQL Objects? 

Join me in this demo heavy session where we will explore the benefits of versioning your SQL Objects and learn how it can enable streamlined database development without sacrificing control and visibility. We’ll be using Red Gate’s SQL Source Control tool for demos, and we’ll see how it integrates with your existing version control software to manage your SQL Objects just like application code.</description>

      <title>Cluster Standalone SQL Server Instances at “Ludicrous” Speed</title>
      <description>Join CTO of DH2i, OJ Ngo, for a live demo and discussion as he builds out a very unconventional SQL Server failover cluster. He will show you how to take standalone SQL Server instances on a mix of different OS and SQL Server versions/editions and transform them into an automated HA cluster with multi-subnet geo-clustering capability—all in just a few minutes.

With speed like that, there will still be plenty of time to show you:
•	QoS controls at the instance level
•	SQL and OS updates as fast as an application stop/start
•	How this solution can save you 30-60% on licensing costs

Stop slaving over your traditional WSFC environments and learn why Global 500 customers have adopted this profoundly simple, Microsoft certified solution.</description>

      <title>Split, Merge and Eliminate - An Introduction to Partitioning</title>
      <description>In my life as a Consultant, partitioning is one of the least used or even inefficiently used components of SQL Server that I have seen.  Partitioning provides many potential benefits such as easier index maintenance,  data loads and archiving using partition switching and improved query performance through partition elimination..
In this session we'll cover the basics of partitioning - from getting started with partition switching to partition elimination to make your queries go faster - with plenty of demos for you to take away.</description>

      <title>The Lost Science of Set Theory</title>
      <description>Many database developers today do not have a Computer Science degree and may also have begun their career developing software using procedural programming languages (Java, C#, etc.). As a result, they may not have the background needed to conceptualize solutions in terms of sets of data and therefore may not be able to develop efficient set-based queries. In this session, we will review the basics of set theory and how it applies to database development to enable you to turn cursors, loops, and other procedural programming practices into efficient set-based operations that make the most use of a relational database engine.</description>

      <description>We’ll explain and demo techniques you are missing out on that you can use to solve difficult sql problems using sql windowing functions including: - Determining how many stops a sport-band user made during a day and how long their average stop was, adjusting for altitude and position using both windowing functions and sql spatial functions. - Merging separate fiscal calendars with differing periods and different granularities (month vs. day, etc.) - Finding equivalent fiscal days or calendar days in previous or future years - Calculating percentiles on data to be used for Analytic tools and more! </description>

      <title>Using a gateway to leverage on-premises data in Power BI</title>
      <description>I look at how you can take advantage of an on-premises gateway to make use of local data when creating reports and dashboards for Power BI. This will start with Power BI Desktop, and the choices you have for SQL Server and Analysis Services. It will then move to the cloud and look at hosting your files on OneDrive for Business, and what this means for data freshness. We will then look at options for personal use or a more centralized use. It will finish off with looking at some troubleshooting tools available to you when working with data refresh.</description>

      <description>Azure SQL Database has a different security model than on premise SQL Server. Although similar, the differences are important and sometimes subtle. In addition to role based security in Azure SQL Database, Azure itself has a role based security model that is independent from the role based security model of Azure SQL Database. This PowerPoint free presentation is all demos where the different security models are deconstructed and explained.</description>
