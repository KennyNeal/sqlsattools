      <title>SQL Server 2016: A dive into Data Quality Services</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016: Data quality and data cleansing have always been major challenges to any enterprise that deals with data. For those of us who have dealt with Data Profiler Tasks in SQL Server 2008, we were shocked yet pleasantly surprised with the great advances that Microsoft has made with the advent of Data Quality Services, in the SQL Server 2012 release. In this hands-on presentation we shall be looking at how to set up a new knowledge base, based upon an existing one, set up rules, do knowledge discovery within the new knowledge base and finally cleanse the data through a data quality project. The end results being more effective data, guaranteed to keep end users and management happy.</description>

      <title>Query Optimization Techniques</title>
      <description>How often have you been told that an application is running quot;too slowquot;?  This statement is the cause of a great deal of investigation, frustration, and dead-ends for database professionals.

The problem won#39;t always be a bad query, but when it is, knowing how to dive in, diagnose its performance, and resolve the situation efficiently will turn a potentially frustrating situation into a fun one!  Using that knowledge in development to prevent future performance issues will improve script quality and application design, while making your future self less burdened by performance emergencies.

This is an opportunity to identify common query mistakes and learn a variety of ways in which we can solve them.  This discussion will include query rewrites, indexing, statistics, database design, monitoring, execution plans, and more!

Demos of poor-performing queries will be provided to illustrate key optimization techniques, design considerations, and the tools you need to fix them.  Fast.</description>

      <title>Should I move my database to the cloud?</title>
      <description>So you have been running on-prem SQL Server for a while now.  Maybe you have taken the step to move it from bare metal to a VM, and have seen some nice benefits.  Ready to see a TON more benefits?  If you said "YES!", then this is the session for you as I will go over the many benefits gained by moving your on-prem SQL Server to an Azure VM (IaaS).  Then I will really blow your mind by showing you even more benefits by moving to Azure SQL Database (PaaS/DBaaS).  And for those of you with a large data warehouse, I also got you covered with Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  Along the way I will talk about the many hybrid approaches so you can take a gradual approve to moving to the cloud.  If you are interested in cost savings, additional features, ease of use, and ending the days of upgrading hardware, this is the session for you!</description>

      <title>Big data architectures and the data lake</title>
      <description>With so many new technologies it can get confusing on the best approach to building a big data architecture.  The data lake is a great new concept, usually built in Hadoop, but what exactly is it and how does it fit in?  In this presentation I’ll discuss the four most common patterns in big data production implementations, the top-down vs bottoms-up approach to analytics, and how you can use a data lake and a RDBMS data warehouse together.  We will go into detail on the characteristics of a data lake and its benefits, and how you still need to perform the same data governance tasks in a data lake as you do in a data warehouse.  Come to this presentation to make sure your data lake does not turn into a data swamp!</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</title>
      <description>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments. Got an SQL virtualization or performance question? Bring it!</description>

      <title>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</title>
      <description>Abstract:

Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?

This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>SSAS Tabular 2016: Not the Little Brother Anymore!</title>
      <description>Since released with SQL Server 2012, SSAS Tabular has been considered appropriate for small to mid-sized BI projects such as Power Pivot migrations but not equipped for large-scale enterprise deployments. Features such as many-to-many relationships, role playing dimensions, language translations as well as query performance at scale have all been factors driving BI professionals to continue to use SSAS Multidimensional mode for corporate BI projects. SSAS Tabular 2016 addresses many of these gaps and also offers a powerful DirectQuery mode, a new Object Model and scripting language, new DAX functions, parallel partition processing, and benefits from a close relationship with Power BI and Excel. 

Come to this session to learn about the new features, walk through the essential design and administration tasks, and see how Tabular can be leveraged by different reporting and analysis tools including Power BI, Excel, and SSRS.</description>

      <title>Leaving the Past Behind: Rewriting Your Checklist for SQL 2016</title>
      <description>How big should the page file be for Windows Server 2016? How many data files should SQL Server 2016's TempDB contain? What trace flags should we use by default now?
 
These are questions you addressed long ago in your setup checklist. You've spent a lot of time with that checklist, and you're sure it's perfect. Or is it? When was the last time you visited that checklist?  Does it make sense for SQL 2014? What about SQL 2016? Change is hard, and DBAs need to constantly challenge yesterday's best practices to ensure they meet today's business needs.
 
Join veteran DBA Mike Hillwig and his list of server administration best practices that need to be revisited for modern versions of SQL Server, especially SQL 2016.</description>

      <title>Natively Compiled T-SQL: The Fastest T-SQL Ever</title>
      <description>SQL Server’s In-Memory tables are accompanied by Natively Compiled Stored Procedures and Functions that run at amazing speed.  We'll:

•	Review in-memory tables
•	Look at the T-SQL language that can be used in Natively Compiled code
•	Discuss how transaction handling is different due to the use of optimistic concurrency
•	Recompile query plans as needed
•	Take a look at DMVs and extended events
•	Compare natively compiled functions to the alternatives forms

How the speed improvements are achieved is a fascinating topic.  We’ll take a look at the C code that SQL produces and uses as an intermediate step.  Somewhere in the C is the query plan and we will hunt for them.

If you want your application to be more than just fast, consider using Natively Compiled T-SQL.  It can make your database code run really, really fast.</description>

      <title>Size Maters Not</title>
      <description>What changes when either the workload or the database grows. Thomas designed build and operated the infrastructure of some of the most demanding workloads ever run on SQL Server. In this session he will share what needed to be done different and what surprising findings he made.
 
He will cover topics including but not limited to: handling a lot of transactions per second, managing large databases and tables with a lot of rows , inserting a lot of new data and updating a lot from many places at once, and managing many SQL Server instances.
 
The goal of the session is to show that SQL Server can scale and that when used correctly has no problem doing so.

      <title>Taking the pain out of database migrations</title>
      <description>Database migrations are scary. The migration of a database has many moving pieces and things to think about. Some of those things have nothing to do with the DBA and are outside of their control. However, if these items are not taken into account, it is the DBA that management will hold responsible for the failure. 

This session will discuss what you need to take into account to ensure a successful pain free database migration. These steps can be used for a single database, multiple databases, or an entire server. By the end of the session, you will have a checklist of the items you need to consider for a database migration. </description>

      <description>Host Andy Mallon persuades some of the biggest names in SQL Server to give up some surprisingly personal information during his chats with them in front of a worshipful audience of database professionals.

The interviewees talk about their childhood, how they got started in the business, their early career, and behind-the-scenes trivia. The interview concludes with the Proust Questionnaire, made famous by Bernard Pivot (Apostrophes) and James Lipton (Inside the Actors Studio). After that, students can question the interviewee directly.</description>
