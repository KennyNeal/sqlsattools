      <title>How to troubleshoot beyond what you understand</title>
      <description>Troubleshooting can be easy when the cause of an issue is obvious - except sometimes it isn't because it's not. In those cases, how do you find the cause - especially when it's something you don't directly control? You're having issues with your storage, but is it a result of RAID being setting up improperly or a constraint on the fiber channel switch? Can you tell the difference between a blockage of firewall ports and a network switch that's nearing capacity? You're not a SAN admin or a firewall engineer, but you don't need to be to understand enough to identify whether these systems are involved.

In this session, we'll talk about troubleshooting as a process - how you can identify issues beyond what you can see and may not understand. While we may discuss some specific situations or hard-to-identify causes in the examples, the session will be focused on understanding the impact of different issues, and how you can better identify the cause of an issue when it's outside your system.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Indexes:  Part 2 -- The rest of the story!</title>
      <description>This session is a continuation of my in-memory table presentation (Part 1) given at 8 SQL Saturdays in 2016 only now concentrating on in-memory indexes.  This session will do an in-depth dive into hash, range, and columnstore indexes in the in-memory environment.  It will be about 30% presentation and 70% demos with emphasis on when and how to apply in-memory indexes for stated environments/scenarios.  
After this session you will
1.	 Understand the three in-memory index types, how to create, and when to apply them for selected scenarios
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables/indexes
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory tables/indexes</description>

      <title>JSON and the Astronauts</title>
      <description>In one small step, SQL Server 2016 has taken a giant leap...to JSON! In this session, we'll launch a probe into a JSON data file containing profiles of NASA astronauts using new JSON T-SQL functions in SQL Server. With each astronaut we meet, we'll learn to validate, read, and manipulate "unstructured" JSON data. We'll get The Right Stuff to start developing, no previous JSON experience required. Let's go where NoSQL has gone before!

Prerequisites:
You should have experience writing queries in T-SQL. No previous knowledge of JSON is needed.

Goals:
Learn about JSON, and its basic data types
Discover how SQL Server 2016 can handle JSON data
Be amazed at the cool people NASA sends into space!</description>

      <title>Are you down with MPP? - Part 1 - Hadoop Based Solutions</title>
      <description>Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architectures allow the use of large numbers of processors (or computers) to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously.  MPP architectures can help with the processing and aggregation of large volumes of data with varying shapes, but can be complicated and costly to deploy and maintain.  We'll explore using the Microsoft Azure cloud as a platform for quickly creating cost-effective MPP solutions.  We will use Microsoft Azure to deploy and process data with a Hadoop based MMP architecture (using HDInsight).  The pros and cons of Hadoop based MPP, as well as when a company might choose a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering over an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution.  This talk will be packed full of demos and real-world learnings.</description>

      <title>A Masters Passport to Extended Events</title>
      <description>"As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This full day session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE.  Take advantage</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of Select</title>
      <description>TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.</description>

      <title>Query Optimization Statistics : Driving Force Behind Performance</title>
      <description>When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues – and solutions –  that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys, correlated predicates, skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information.</description>

      <title>PowerBI, from a DBA</title>
      <description>Microsoft’s PowerBI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement PowerBI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point PowerBI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, PowerBI, and how to make these work for you.

You will be given permissions to an Azure DB, and get connected to this source. You will also need to have PowerBI desktop downloaded and installed. We will be using this to create the report during the session. So please come prepared to interact with the internet, with a cloud-based database you will be provided, and PowerBI Desk</description>

      <title>I/O Tuning 101</title>
      <description>One of the most common problems I have encountered as a DBA is the complaints from users that a particular query is slow, just one query.  Many times one that used to run in acceptable time, but that over time has slowed down substantially.

In this session we will show some of the causes for this, with emphasis on I/O requests being too high for the query.  

First part of the session will explain how to find these numbers, looking at a few queries with some major performance issues, including explaining why they have a problem.

The second part will focus on how to reduce I/O requests.

All of this can be done without the need for any 3rd party tools, all within the scope of what is available to SQL Server, all versions, all editions, including Azure.</description>

      <title>Faster Provisioning with SQL Clone</title>
      <description>Database provisioning requests are the bane of many DBA’s working lives. Developers want to work with realistic data, DBAs want to protect Production and secure data.
 
But copying databases for development and test is a job that gets 'delegated up'; DBAs, IT Managers, those with the keys to Production find themselves performing the task, and the development team is often blocked while it takes place.
 
The same people are often responsible for ensuring the copy is appropriate for the environment (permissions, configuration data, sensitive data), so have to perform semi-manual tasks and maintain brittle scripts to do so.
 
In this session Redgate’s Grant Fritchey shows how new tool SQL Clone enables self-service or easy automation of database copies and is near-instant at the time of need, using a fraction of the disk space, and allowing quick reversion to a baseline or snapshotting of changes.</description>

      <title>Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog</title>
      <description>The SSIS catalog is one of the best-evolved features in the SQL Server Integration Services ecosystem. With integrated package storage, Windows ACL-like security settings, built-in logging, and many other features, the SSIS catalog has become an anchor for many ETL architectures. With all this complexity, it is important to understand the inner workings of the SSIS catalog to keep it running smoothly.

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will dive into the details of the SSIS catalog. We will start with a quick survey of catalog features, followed by an exploration of the moving parts (tables, views, and stored procedures) in the catalog database. We will also review the security capabilities in the catalog, and will discuss maintenance operations. Finally, we'll walk through the mechanics of deployment and execution, reviewing what happens under the covers during these operations.</description>

      <title>Pick the right R - R, Microsoft R Open and Microsoft R Server</title>
      <description>After Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics, it has released Microsoft R Open (MRO, formerly Revolution R Open) and Microsoft R Server (MRS,   formerly Revolution R Enterprise). While there is publicly available information on these, analytics community is still getting familiar with these. During the presentation, Divya will address these three questions – 
•	What do R, MRO, and MRS have in common?
•	What’s new in MRO and MRS compared with R?
•	Why should I use MRO or MRS instead of R?
In addition to this, she will also give a demo of how to get started with Microsoft R Open and Microsoft R Server. She will also demonstrate how to deploy an end to end application using SQL Server R Services and Power BI.</description>

      <description>To a beginner, indexes may seem like magic. The right index can drastically reduce query time. But, how do you know which indexes are the right ones? SQL Server will suggest helpful indexes in the graphical execution plan and with the Database Engine Tuning Advisor, but follow that advice with caution. This session will explain how indexes work and how to tune indexes so that your application has the best performance.</description>

      <title>SS2014/2016 In-Memory Tables --Formula One Performance Unleashed, Part 1</title>
      <description>Query performance is what it is all about.  SQL Server 2014/2016 now has the new in-memory functionality that takes a completely different approach to data access and manipulation.  This session will consolidate the relevant information from all these sources so the production DBA/Developer will be able to understand, create, use, maintain, and trouble-shoot in-memory table functionality.  This session will also examine several demo scripts showing performance gains using the in-memory tables with and without columnstore indexes over equivalent disk based tables.  
This session is all about when and how to apply in-memory tables in a production environment.
After this session you will
1.	 Understand what in-memory tables are and how to create and maintain them including their limitations
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory table</description>

      <title>Sentiment Analysis with R</title>
      <description>Companies today are using sentiment analysis to improve customer experience by understanding the attitude of their customers based on tweets, facebook posts, and other social networking outlets. The ability to perceive a customer’s feelings benefits that company by advising them on what changes they can make to improve their customer’s experiences. A great way to do this is in open-source tools such as R. In R, we can classify the polarity as well as the emotion behind a comment from Twitter feeds. Rachael will show the basics of using a few R functions to do this, with visualizations as well.</description>

      <title>SQL lessons learned operating at scale</title>
      <description>When your SQL Server environment runs 24*7 and is *very sensitive* to interruptions, how one performs basic maintenance activities, supports development and deployment, and ensures proper backups requires a different mindeset for performing these tasks.
Everything from how you implement SQL Server to how a table is designed requires a different thought process when the daily "overnight" or weekly "downtime" windows do not exist.  
Everything you do happens alongside and impacts user-facing activity.
In this session I will present various high-level lessons learned along the path of user happiness in an always-in-use environment.</description>

      <title>Are you down with MPP? - Part 2 - SQL Based Solutions</title>
      <description>Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architectures allow the use of large numbers of processors (or computers) to perform a set of coordinated computations simultaneously.  MPP architectures can help with the processing and aggregation of large volumes of data with varying shapes, but can be complicated and costly to deploy and maintain.  We'll explore using the Microsoft Azure cloud as a platform for quickly creating cost-effective MPP solutions.  We will use Microsoft Azure to deploy and process data with a SQL based MMP architecture (Azure SQL Data Warehouse).  The pros and cons of SQL based MPP will be discussed, as well as when a company might choose a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering over an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution.  This talk will be packed full of demos and real-world learnings.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows that Azure SQL Database only supports a small subset of SQL Server functionality, small databases, and has really bad performance. Except, everyone is wrong. In fact, Azure SQL Server Database is ready to support many, if not most, databases within your enterprise. This session reintroduces Azure SQL Database and shows the high degree of functionality and improved performance that is now available. We'll cover topics from monitoring, to high availability to disaster recovery, all within Azure SQL Database. You’ll leave this session with a more thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Azure SQL Database so that you can make a more informed choice over when, or if, you should use it within your environment.</description>

      <description>SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. 

This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions, and create simpler code by using the window functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.</description>

      <title>Fun with SQL Server Spatial Data</title>
      <description>This session is an introduction to the spatial features in SQL Server. In this session, you will learn how to create, procure and leverage spatial data.  You will be made aware of tools you can use to integrate your own spatial data with a variety of public data sources such as the Census Bureau, National Weather Service, etc. Functions and T-SQL commands related to spatial data analysis will be demonstrated. We will end the session by using the geometry data type to actually mimic a bitmapped picture using SQL (that's the fun part!).</description>

      <title>Change Data Capture, maybe you should consider it again.</title>
      <description>Change Data Capture (CDC) was released with SQL Server 2008 and has been enhanced in several subsequent releases of SQL Server. Sever Stored Procedures were first provided to aid in using CDC with ETL and/or other CDC related processes. SQL Server 2012 included the release of the CDC Source and several other SSIS Task that greatly simplified the process of using CDC in your ETL. In this session, I want to share some of the creative uses I have seen involving CDC and hear about some of the things you have seen and or done with it.</description>

      <title>It’s Time for a Change: Temporal Table Support in SQL Server 2016</title>
      <description>Without temporal tables (AKA history tables), we can only see the current version of data. We can’t see rows that have been deleted or rows as they existed before the latest update. The temporal table support in SQL Server 2016 gives us the ability to create system maintained “history” tables to track all changes to the table data.

In this session we’ll discuss how you can benefit from temporal support in your tables, how to implement temporal tables in SQL Server 2016, and how to write “time travel queries” using the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME clause in a SELECT statement to easily query historical information.</description>

      <title>Change Detection in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Change detection is a critical component of any system that moves data from one structure to another. Most data movement mechanisms are designed to move a subset of the data – only that which is new or changed since the last load. For that to work properly, there must be a reliable system for detecting delta data touched since the most recent load. 

In this session, we will review the tools and design patterns available in SQL Server for performing change detection. From source detection methods including change tracking and change data capture, to in-flight comparisons using hashed values, and even brute-force methods as a last resort, we’ll cover the spectrum of change detection tools in SQL Server.</description>

      <description>What's it like moving your SQL based application to the Cloud?  There is a lot to consider before you make the leap.  Azure VM (IaaS) or Service (PaaS)? Resource Manager or Classic Deployment, Authentication, Application Architecture, Networking, Backups, Migration Planning, Performance, Cost Estimating and Monitoring are issues that you will need to address for a successful implementation.  During this session I will cover how these issues were addressed from planning stage one year ago to a production SQL server in Azure.  Pickup tips and scripts. Learn from our mistakes and assumptions and avoid blind alleys.</description>

      <title>Tableau and Power BI-Compare and Contrast</title>
      <description>The goal of self-service BI is to give users the means to interact and understand their data quickly. There are a plethora of tools in the Market. For many years Tableau was the undisputed leader in this rapidly evolving space. Post 2015 a new tool from Microsoft emerged – Power BI. It was and is still considered a disruptor in the Data visualization space.

Faced with a tool that has been in the market for over 10 years and a rapidly evolving product that has the backing of a Software giant from Redmond , how does an individual or an organization go about choosing the right product. Let’s dive deeper. In this demonstration rich session we’ll look at how the tools compare against different functional scenarios.

We’ll see how each tool can handle-

-	Represent Data using Maps
-	Drill downs and Hierarchies
-	Trending and Forecasting 
-	Grouping and Organizing data
-	Combing data from different sources and source type
-       Community support
And much more..!</description>

      <title>Turbo Boost Performance: In Memory Tables index optimizations</title>
      <description>With the introduction of in-memory based tables in SQL Server 2014, it’s natural to expect  significant increases in query performance. But what do we do when queries which utilize in-memory tables actually start to perform same or, in some cases, even worse than their equivalent disk based table predecessors?  In this session, we are going to take a look at the changes to the indexing design for in-memory based objects and how it differs from existing disk based table indexing. Also, we are going to cover how to choose the appropriate indexes for your in-memory object to give you the performance boost that you have been expecting.</description>

      <description>SQL Server offers several isolation levels beyond the default "READ COMMITTED".  But understanding when to use each one can be daunting.  Whether you are a developer who needs to understand how isolation works and  and why NOLOCK is not an appropriate hint in most cases, or a seasoned DBA who needs to understand the less commonly used isolation methods, this session is for you.  We will look at each level, how it impacts the engine, and examine appropriate (and inapproriate) use cases for each.</description>

      <title>APPLY Yourself</title>
      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>
