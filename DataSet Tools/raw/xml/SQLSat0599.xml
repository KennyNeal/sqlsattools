      <description>I am currently working as a Data Engineer, improving the company data platform and providing the necessary resources for our data consultants. I am extremely fortunate to dabble with a number of tools including those from the Microsoft BI stack and NoSQL tech like Neo4j, R and Python. My strengths lie in integrating multiple technologies for a specific business problem.

I aim to present material that BI consultants and developers can all take away something new to apply to their own work processes. I try to apply knowledge and skills from my previous life as a neuroscientist and as a blindfolded Rubik's Cube world record holder. I am of the belief that, one day, neuroscience and big data will come together in a big way.</description>

      <description>Time ago (a lot of time ago…) an excellent IT pro brought me with him and became my Mentor in the IT wonderland…it was a world full of mainframes…
I met the Relational theory when there were no commercial RDBMS, and I was spellbound by that “magic”. When Microsoft appeared in the IT market, I felt finally which trek I had to follow. I’m still walking on such road, and in my rucksack I’ve ben putting some other stuff (like SharePoint, for example). My sole regret:  I’ve left the College to consecrate all my time to my job; curiously, since then, I’ve never stop learning…</description>

      <title>A Game of Hierarchies: Mastering Recursive Queries</title>
      <description>Hierarchies are the bread and butter of most business applications and you find them almost everywhere:
* Product Categories
* Sales Territories
* Calendar and Time
Even when there is a big need from a business perspective, the solutions in relational databases are still sort of awkward. The most flexible hierarchies are modeled as self-referenced tables. If you want to successfully query such self-referenced hierarchies, you will need either loops or recursive Common Table Expressions. You will learn how to master both and will learn how make them fast.
Join this session for a journey through best practices to transform your hierarchies into useful information. We will have fun playing around with a sample database based on G. R. R. Martin’s famous “Game of Thrones”.</description>

      <title>Enabling Citizen Data Science with Microsoft</title>
      <description>In times past, Data Science was only for those elite few with a rare combination of skills including advanced knowledge of statistics.

Microsoft has been making sure that everyone can participate in the data revolution by giving people access to predictive API’s, in-database advanced analytics and drag-and-drop predictive experiments. All thanks to SQL Server 2016 and the Cortana Intelligence Suite in Azure.

These advances have given people with less knowledge of statistics and programming the ability to become what Gartner calls citizen data scientists.
Should we be worried about fools-with-tools or should we embrace the democratization of data science as the golden age of data?

Using a combination of theory and demo’s, we explore Microsoft’s solutions to ensure democratization of data science and the possible dangers that lurk below the surface.</description>

      <title>Azure SQL Datawarehouse: 0-100 DWUs</title>
      <description>So, with much fanfare and cheering, Azure DataWarehouse is now live, but what does that mean to you? Reflecting on a large-scale Azure DW project, this session gathers together learnings, successes, failures and general opinions into a crash course in using Azure DataWarehouse “properly”.

We'll start by quickly putting the technology in context, so you know WHEN to use it, WHERE it’s appropriate and WHY it works the way it does.

 - Introducing the ADW technology
 - Explaining distributions  performance
 - Explaining polybase

We will then dive into HOW to use it, looking at some real-life design patterns, best practice and some “tales from the trenches” from a recent large Azure DW project.

 - Performance tips  tricks (designing for minimal data movement, managing distribution skew, CTAS, Resource classes and more)
 - ETL Patterns (Surrogate keys  Orchestration)
 - Common Mistakes  Pitfalls
 - Conclusions  Recommendations</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Data with SQL Server 2016 and R</title>
      <description>With the addition of R into SQL Server 2016, Microsoft have provided a few extra degrees of freedom for the standard SQL developer. You can now use the R language to wrangle, clean and collect external data, using libraries and functionality that simply wasn’t available to you before with regular T-SQL. Performing data enrichment at scale with SQL Server or even Microsoft R Server can provide extremely valuable new insights for your clients and start reaping the benefits of big data.

In this session, Consolidata’s Oliver Frost shows you how to develop your own application for tapping into ‘dark data’. Ollie will demonstrate how to stream live tweets, perform aggregations in R and pipe the output to a Power BI dashboard, giving you a full end-to-end experience of the importance of learning some basic R code in 2016. 

This session is for anyone who is new to R and is interested in expanding their skill set beyond their comfort zone in SQL Server.</description>

      <title>Hacking SQL Server</title>
      <description>How easy is it to hack a SQL Server? 
In this session we'll see examples on how to exploit SQL Server, modify data and take control, while at the same time not leaving a trace.
We'll start by gaining access to a SQL Server (using some "creative" ways of making man-in-the-middle attacks), escalating privileges and tampering with data at the TDS protocol level (e.g. changing your income level and reverting without a trace after payment), hacking DDM, and more. 
Most importantly, we'll also cover recommendations on how to avoid these attacks, and take a look at the pros and cons of new security features in SQL Server 2016.
This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants.</description>

      <title>Running MSSQL on Mac OS - Mission Possible</title>
      <description>Recently Microsoft has released SQL Server 2016 for Linux. It features another option option to run MSSQL on Mac OS using Docker.
Probably, you would never choose this option for your production environment but it is a good opportunity for all Mac fans to have a working database running on their MacBooks. 
In this session we will go through all options to run SQL Server on Mac OS and what development tools are available to connect and use your database.
The session will include a live demo, so you will be able to see step by step the installation process and how you can connect and use the database.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2016: Improvements to In-Memory OLTP</title>
      <description>In-Memory OLTP has been significantly improved, so that this technology enable scaling to larger databases and higher throughput in order to support bigger workloads. Moreover, a number of limitations concerning tables and stored procedures have been removed to make it easier to migrate your applications to and leverage their benefits. In this session we will explore the new and enhanced features (like altering Memory-optimized Tables and Natively Compiled Stored Procedures, using Scalar UDF, supporting subqueries in Natively Complied Stored Procedures and more).</description>

      <title>SQL Server Collation: A small leak will sink a great ship</title>
      <description>The collation is one of the most misunderstood settings in SQL Server. But if you underestimate it, you could get into a lot of troubles.
Attend this session to understand what the collation is. How could the collation impact the performance of your queries, linked servers or cross database queries. 
What are the good practices and how to cope with different collations? What kind of issues can be caused by unequal collations, what to be taken into account?</description>

      <title>Are your SQL Server indexes effective?</title>
      <description>Indexes are important! They can make your life easy, but they can be a huge performance killer. No matter your role - DBA or DEV, you need to design effective indexing strategy and most importantly - know if those indexes are really effective. SQL Server gives you number of possibilities to track the use of your indexes and suggest you new ones. But what else we need to be careful for? How to keep our SQL Server in proper index shape? Join me for this one-hour session where we will have real fun on indexes and I promise you, you will leave with plenty of ideas for improving your index environment!</description>

      <title>Meta-Data Driven Tabular Modeling with TOM in SSAS</title>
      <description>Analysis Services 2016 uses JSON as a format to store the metadata of a model and you can change it with C# using TOM (Tabular Object Model). The new object model has a one-to-one mapping between physical entities in the database and objects in the model. This is very usefull if you need to add or change measures without redeploying the whole project to server.
For example, you need to generate set of new measures every year or end users want to add measures themselves and so on.  Using TOM and meta-data table you can automate this process and save tons of time. Join this session for learning how to implement this.</description>

      <title>I am a DBA! "What is the next"?</title>
      <description>In this session, we will discuss where to start when you get your job as a DBA. What are the first steps you need to do to discover and arrange the environment for which you are responsible. How to answer questions like: How many databases do you have on each server? How big are they? What they are used for and how many of them are critical? Do you need backups and do you have such, Etc. There are many questions you got from the day 1, but where to start is always the key to not get panicked. The goal of this session is to help you perform your first steps in a DBA job, especially when you get into a situation with only one Excel spreadsheet containing your servers’ list.</description>
