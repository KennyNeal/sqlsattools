      <description>I'm fascinated with finding data-driven ways to alleviate the mundane and to simplify complex decisions. My various roles have shared a healthy amount of advanced analytics, data communication, machine learning, anomaly detection and response prioritisation. At the moment, I am really excited about search (i.e. Elasticsearch) and how we can build upon search to transform our business processes.</description>

      <title>Beginners Guide to HA/DR, that can save your Bacon.</title>
      <description>High Availability and Disaster Recovery have been an enterprise requirement since SQL Server was first released. In this full day session I will take you through current options to design and implement HA/DR solutions meeting the ever increasing demands of corporate environments.  The content will look at what is currently available to us to use in an On-premises, Cloud, or Hybrid environments, specifically outlining the exciting new features that make it compelling to migrate immediately to SQL Server 2016.
I will cover the following topics across 3 modules for the day:
•	Define and characterize HA/DR and the options provided by SQL Server
•	Design an appropriate HA/DR solution to meet requirements for either an On-premises, Cloud, or Hybrid environments
•	Examine multiple technologies / features together to satisfy complex requirements and their implementation in complex environments</description>

      <description>Cortana Analytics delivers an end-to-end platform with an integrated and comprehensive set of tools and services to help users to build intelligent applications. This session will show how Cortana can be used for monitoring live data collected from devices like weather sensors  and how we can use Cortana intelligence suit to monitor the live data and apply some machine learning process on them. In this Demo I will show how to set up an IoT device like Raspberry PI, how to use different components of Cortana Intelligence suite  for transferring data (Azure service bus and azure stream analytics), storing data in a azure SQL database, getting insights from collected data using azure ML,  and finally showing the results through  automatically in Power BI.</description>

      <title>Protecting your data from SQL Injection attacks</title>
      <description>Kevin will be talking on the topic of SQL injection - something that all of us need to be aware of and protect against. 

And here is a blurb from:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A1-Injection

" The best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to injection is to verify that all use of interpreters clearly separates untrusted data from the command or query. For SQL calls, this means using bind variables in all prepared statements and stored procedures, and avoiding dynamic queries. 
Checking the code is a fast and accurate way to see if the application uses interpreters safely. Code analysis tools can help a security analyst find the use of interpreters and trace the data flow through the application. Penetration testers can validate these issues by crafting exploits that confirm the vulnerability."

Kevin will give us a demo that will show an injection attack in action and how to mitigate it.</description>

      <title>DevOPs and the DBA</title>
      <description>You may have heard the word "DevOps" and wondered whether it is just another buzzword and/or what it can do for you.
In this session I will demystify the concepts of DevOps and we will look at two aspects of DevOps - Continuous Integration  Continuous Delivery.

Continuous Integration is the practice in which software developers frequently integrate their work with that of other members of the development team.It also involves automating tests around the integrated work

​Continuous Delivery is the next step after Continuous Integration in the deployment pipeline and is the process of automating the deployment of software to  test, staging, and production environments.

Database migrations/changes are an area that may not be typically automated or utilise Continuous Delivery.

Through the use of a comprehensive live demo to a running production database the audience will learn the benefits and how to implement Continuous Delivery in their database systems deployment pipeline.</description>

      <title>Schroedinger’s Backup – will your recovery work?</title>
      <description>If you do not test your recovery plan you are unknowingly running a Schrödinger’s backup experiment, as your backup can be thought of as both being a good backup and being a bad backup. Until you attempt a restore the condition of any Backup is unknown.

While Schrödinger’s  cat was a thought experiment that may have injured an imaginary feline, a failure to be able to recover databases when required can prove  terminal to both careers   and Companies.

In this session Patrick will walk you through how to design,  create and test Recovery strategies. Using T-SQL and PowerShell you will leave with the tools necessary to avoid you own failed Schroedinger’s Backup experiment.</description>

      <title>Cardinality Estimator: A Ride from SQL 7.0 to SQL Server 2016</title>
      <description>Cardinality estimator, providing row estimates plays a pivotal role in obtaining efficient query plans. Cardinality estimator, which had remained unchanged since SQL 7.0, was revamped in SQL Server 2014 and was further changed in SQL Server 2016. Presentation will compare the differences between old cardinality estimator (CE 70), cardinality estimator 2014 (CE 120) and cardinality estimator 2016 (CE 130). The presentation will showcase several common real world scenarios which would directly benefit from the latest cardinality estimator. Presentation would take a deep dive ride covering the behind the scene tales detailing how the new cardinality estimator performs row estimates, resulting in accurate query plans. Presentation would also explain how regression testing can be performed using SQL Server 2016 Query Store and will highlight the scenarios where one needs to strike a balance between old and new cardinality estimators.</description>

      <description>Power Query is a relatively new addition to Microsoft Excel that brings ETL to the self service BI user's desktop.  In this level 200 session I cover the basics of Power Query and how it can be used for desktop BI before quickly moving on to demonstrate how you can use Power Query for more advanced scenarios that you may not have thought of before, including:
	• Use Power Query as a data provider for traditional Excel Pivot Tables without using Power Pivot.
	• Building a Power Pivot calendar table from scratch using pure Power Query steps.
	• Add commentary to bank statements and make those comments "stick" using self-referencing tables.
	• Using Power Query as an auditing and exception management
        • Using Power Query as a pure ETL tool and exporting more than 1 m rows of transformed data to a file.</description>

      <description>Ask a statistician, or a data scientist, what it takes to become a serious machine learning (ML) practitioner and you will get a daunting list including in-depth knowledge of mathematics, statistics, machine learning theory and that elusive magic sauce. In this session, we will break down these stereotypes and argue that the essential skills are: a love of data, tenacity and a healthy dose of scepticism.

We will build a prediction pipeline using AzureML and cover the essential elements of the machine learning workflow, from data preparation, prediction, evaluation and communication.</description>

      <description>Azure SQL DB promises low touch once you have deployed your database.  However the reality is that to gain the maximum benefit and lowest cost, you still need to be proactive with monitoring and management of your database.
This session will identify the main aspects of the Azure SQL DBA role, including how to ensure you have longer term backups (if you need them for compliance), how to manage your Tier level automatically, how to ensure you have the best performance to keep your DTUs to a minimum.
You will leave this session with a better story for your manager to convince him to move your workload to Azure and lower your total SQL Server costs.</description>

Come along to this session and learn some tips and tricks that have been gained over many years.
