      <description>For over 15 years Shannon Lowder has been spotting patterns and learning ways to work smarter instead of harder. He started with development and moved into database administration. Using TSQL, Database Jobs and PowerShell, he automated himself out of contracts quickly.  As Business Intelligence became a greater demand, he moved into SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS development.  Early on, he tried using PowerShell and .Net to automate BI Development. Later those efforts turned to Biml.  After founding a startup six years ago, he finds himself a data platform consultant, designing and guiding other professionals to build highly automated enterprise solutions.  Today, he is a Biml Hero candidate and is awaiting the final approval for the award.</description>

      <description>For over 15 years Shannon Lowder has been spotting patterns and learning ways to work smarter instead of harder. He started with development and moved into database administration. Using TSQL, Database Jobs and PowerShell, he automated himself out of contracts quickly.  As Business Intelligence became a greater demand, he moved into SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS development.  Early on, he tried using PowerShell and .Net to automate BI Development. Later those efforts turned to Biml.  After founding a startup six years ago, he finds himself a data platform consultant, designing and guiding other professionals to build highly automated enterprise solutions.  Today, he is a Biml Hero candidate and is awaiting the final approval for the award.</description>

      <title>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Tune Like a Guru!</title>
      <description>In this Pre-Con event we will cover a wide array of topics that form the backbone of my SQL Server performance analysis and tuning work.  As a long-time relational engine consultant I have repeatedly found that the majority of clients I work with get amazing improvements by simply putting to use a fairly small collection of knowledge and tools.  We will cover many topics, including:
  
- Server, virtualization and database configuration
- Optimization processes
- Statistics
- Indexing
- Understanding query plans
- Improving design
- Improving code
- Profiler use and analysis
- Temp object usage
- Waits and IO stall analysis
- ORM Badness
 
We will look at all of these things and more from a variety of angles, while also covering many of the tips, tricks, tools, etc. I have collected in my almost 45,000 man hours of working with SQL Server.  I promise you will come away with lots of immediately-applicable information which you can take back to work and Tune Like A Guru!</description>

      <title>Statistics  Cardinality – How They Work to Find Data Efficiently</title>
      <description>Are your statistics up to date? 
Yes, it’s that dreaded phrase you hear all the time when it comes to performance tuning your SQL Server. What does it matter? Why should I care about statistics? Aren’t they automatic or something like that?
In this session we will go over why statistics matter, how they are generated, how they impact performance, and even how to maintain them. Once we have that all settled, we will take a quick look at how the cardinality estimator uses statistics to determine a ‘good enough’ plan to use. We will close out the session by taking a look at the performance impact from a simple upgrade of your SQL Server to 2014 and using the new cardinality estimator.</description>

      <title>Disaster Documents: The role of documentation in disaster recovery</title>
      <description>I was an employee of a company that had an office in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.  Prior to that infamous date, I had written several departmental documents that ended up being critical to our recovery.  In this presentation, I provide a narrative of what happened in the weeks following 9/11, and how documentation played a role in getting the organization back on its feet.

While other disaster recovery presentations talk about strategies, plans, and techniques, this presentation focuses on the documentation itself.  We will discuss the documents we had and how they were used in our recovery.  We will also discuss what documents we didn't have, and how they could have made the process better.</description>

      <title>Efficient table design</title>
      <description>The importance of proper table design cannot be underestimated. Misconceptions could lead into serious problems not only in terms of database performance, but also it can effect disk space management and interactivity of user interface as well. In this session the audience will have a sensible walk-through of database and table design in detail, encompassing a number of key areas of focus ranging from Data Types to FILESTREAM implementation. Discuss most common a table design mistakes. Find out efficiency of one type over another, IDENTITY vs. SEQUENCE vs. GUID to support PK uniqueness, pros and cons of using composite Primary Key and SPARSE column, and more.</description>

      <title>Using Powershell to Document SQL Server</title>
      <description>Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more</description>

      <title>"Full Text indexing!" or..."What is that service I never turn on?"</title>
      <description>If you've ever wondered what that other service is in your configuration manager then this is the class for you.  Full text indexing allows you to write queries to scan large text fields without having to do a complete table scan every time.

We'll talk about installing, setting up, maintaining, and using full text indexes to their fullest!</description>

      <title>The Ins and Outs of SQL Indexes</title>
      <description>This course will focus on the fundamentals of strategic SQL Server index design and creation. Terms that will be covered and clarified: clustered index, non-clustered index, uniqueness, covering index, fill-factor, scan, seek, key lookup, and fragmentation. This is a beginning level course for those who have always found indexes confusing and somewhat elusive.  Lots of valuable information will be provided in a short amount of time.</description>

      <title>Tech Writing for Techies: A Primer</title>
      <description>Documentation is one of the most critical, yet most blatantly ignored and disrespected tasks when it comes to technology.  Businesses and technical professionals ignore documentation at their own risk.  This session discusses what tech writing and documentation is about and why it's critical for business.  It also explores possible reasons for why it's ignored, how documentation can be improved, and how "non-writers" can contribute to the process.</description>

      <title>Why candidates fail the job interview in the first minute</title>
      <description>In the last two decades Thomas always had more open positions than I could fill, not because of lack of applicants, I must have interviewed close to 300 people for DBA, database developer, data architect, data modeling and other data related positions. Come to this highly interactive session to learn why 99% of the candidates failed the simplest questions and disqualified them self.

Thomas will share what he misses in resumes and how to respond to questions better.</description>

      <title>On the Doorsteps - Women in Technology</title>
      <description>Women make up over half of the workforce, and yet there are still discrepancies in pay and in the number of women in certain industries. Technology is one of the industries where women are drastically underrepresented. What factors in industry and society have contributed to these outcomes?

In this session, we will discuss the effects of trends in industry such as college graduation of women in technology fields, and women currently in tech or in positions of leadership. And, even important to us, how the contributions of women in PASS affect our community. This will be an open discussion with input from the audience encouraged.</description>

We will cover the different components of the Power BI ecosystem: PowerQuery, DAX, Power BI visuals, Data gateways, and the Power BI service. Instead of just showing off pretty graphs, we will focus on a more fundamental understanding of these tools.</description>

      <title>APPLY Yourself</title>
      <description>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</description>
