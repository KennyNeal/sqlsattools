      <title>Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!</title>
      <description>Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.</description>

      <description>If Clothes make the Man, Scripts make the DBA! 
Lowell Izaguirre presents his strategy and methodology, featuring a suite of hundreds of stored procedures to allow the analysis,administration and maintenance of server and database objects and "better practices".
This suite of over 75 Server-targeted scripts can turn a Developer or Junior DBA into a superhero. 
Scripts identify server level things like memory, disk speed,backups, database mail,Last Accessed databases or tables, and so much more! Make yourself part of the top 10 percent!
Lowell's codebase introduces a unified strategy for a huge list of Server Level DBA Tasks, where the stored procedures identify best practice variances, issues, as well as suggest fixes for the the problems encountered!</description>

      <title>Introducing the Limitless DBA-  Copy Data Management, DBA Style</title>
      <description>Everything in our day to day lives as a DBA is about limits-
•	Limits in space
•	Limits in platform
•	Limits in resources
•	Limits in expertise


This session is about how to remove those limits.  How to provide all the databases you need without having to constantly ask for more disk space.  How to provide a databases as fast as they are needed for new projects, new test cases and new challenges.  How to do more with less time, less people and less hardware and last but not least, how to do all of this without having to become an expert in 20 different languages, products and specialties. 

Join Kellyn Pot’Vin-Gorman as she demonstrates why virtualization is key to empowering the database administrator.  This session will cover how to:
•	Ease patching and upgrading.
•	Offer virtualized environments for every project-  development through production with only a 1/3 or the resources once required.
•	How to change OS and database platforms without losing your mind.</description>

      <title>T-SQL Performance Guidelines for better DB stress powers</title>
      <description>To reach your desired business functionalities, it can be easy using some common T-SQL practices like MTVF , scalar functions , Temp tables, Union…etc and they might perform pretty well on development server coz neither adequate stress of users nor adequate volume of data exist there but actually they seem totally strange once going to live where they become performing badly ending up eventually with and sharp skew of performance and standstill cases sometimes , this is due to the lack of stress powers of T-SQL codes which should be considered largely for critical mission DBs in particular more therefore I am going to talk to you about How to capture expensive queries using different techniques ..?and How to optimize them in the shortest time using scientific ways ..? (10 different T-SQL Practices will be explained within this session)</description>

      <title>Query Store</title>
      <description>Analyzing query performance can be tricky. It involves knowing several dynamic management views (DMVs) and accessing query plans that are still in the query cache. If you need to get performance metrics for a query which is no longer in the cache, or if your server is restarted it will be an impossible task.
Query Data Store is a new  feature that comes to help DBAs. By persisting query execution data over time, it allows reviewing of statements / plans / properties / statistics.
This session will show you how to enable and use Query Store features, like: obtaining queries with plan changes over time; analyze queries by CPU / Memory / other counters; forcing a plan; and other gems.</description>

      <title>Enabling EDW and BI workloads on Hadoop with Hive / LLAP</title>
      <description>In its origin, Hadoop was created as a distributed computing system designed to process data in batches, but the many advantages of the platform lead to an immediate desire to run interactive analytical queries against Data Lakes built on Hadoop.  So a few years back the Stinger initiative was created as an ongoing effort to bring interactive SQL querying capabilities to Hive, and its latest release has finally delivered! 
In this session, Luis Figueroa (Solutions Engineer @ Hortonworks) will walk you through the latest advancements that make Hadoop a powerful SQL engine that expands you EDW capabilities with unlimited scale and amazing flexibility. Luis will provide a technical overview of the Hive engine, an update on SQL compatibility with the ANSI standard,  real world use cases and a live demo.

      <title>5 Things To Consider: Stretching Failover Clustered Instances  Availability Groups to Azure</title>
      <description>Dealing with SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Groups for local high availability is already complicated with a lot of the external dependencies such as the network and the Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC.) But it becomes even more complicated when you stretch it out for disaster recovery to Microsoft Azure. In this session, learn the five (5) things that you need to consider when you implement SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group for disaster recovery into Microsoft Azure. We will cover how Active Directory, DNS, WSFC heartbeat and quorum configuration affects deployments of SQL Server Failover Clustered Instances and Availability Group in a disaster recovery site and how to properly configure a client application for connectivity.</description>

      <title>Who's Afraid of Entity Framework?</title>
      <description>Do any applications in your environment use SQL written not by a person but by the application itself? No, the system isn't self-aware. Chances are it is using the Microsoft Entity Framework (EF).

EF and other object relational mapping technologies have been a boon for developers. But is EF a technology that developers should even be using? This session reviews what EF is and how it's changed over time. We'll also dive into how it works and what to look for when inspecting a database generated by EF Finally, we'll review EF-generated T-SQL and give some tips on how to improve performance. If you're a data professional who manages databases that are accessed through EF or want a basic knowledge of how EF works, this session is for you.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Creation of Dev/Test/Reporting Databases with SQL Clone</title>
      <description>Imagine a world where developers and testers could run production-like environments on their own workstations, created on-demand and self-serviced. Raising tickets and waiting hours or days to get operations to deliver test databases would be a thing of the past. 

With Redgate's new tool, SQL Clone, this world now exists. Administrators and developers can create their own database copies in seconds using just MEGABYTES of disk space without ever touching production. Developers can see how their application behaves in a production-scale environment during both development and troubleshooting and operations no longer need to find disk space, provision, etc.

In this session we will examine how SQL Clone uses disk virtualization to enable quick, easy and even automated creation of database copies that are just MB in size.</description>

      <title>Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!</title>
      <description>ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, most ORMs suffer from a lot of the same flaws.</description>

      <title>So You think You can Speak?</title>
      <description>If you've ever enjoyed or admired the knowledge and know-how of a speaker at a SQL Saturday or a Summit , remember that they started where you are, with an interest in SQL and I.T. topics, a passion to learn more, but also with the desire to share what they know with their peers.
If you have an interest in SQL or any of the Microsoft Data platform technologies, and have learned something useful in your I.T. career, consider giving back to the community by sharing what you know. While it may seem intimidating to give an hour long talk at an event like this, remember that every great speaker had to start somewhere. And for you, maybe that start is here! 
"Do You Think You can Speak" is a friendly competition for anyone, even first time speakers, to share for 5 - 10 minutes on a technical topic, SQL, Business Intelligence, Power BI, or otherwise, that is informative, useful, and entertaining.</description>

      <title>2,4,8  16 - Upgrade your journey with SQL Server</title>
      <description>2,4,8  16 - these aren't just numbers to count or calculate. These are years that how SQL Server evolved as number of years!

Why Upgrade? 
Data Platform Upgrade topic has been a popular session that I've presented in major conferences like Microsoft Tech-Ed (North America, Europe  India) and SQLbits since 2008. 

In this session, we will overview in depth end-to-end upgrade process that covers the essential phases, steps and issues involved in upgrading  SQL Server (2000 to  2012),  SQL Server 2014 (with a good overview on 2016 too) by using best practices and available resources. 

What to-do and what not-to-do?

A popular session that I have been presenting since the year 2008, in MS Tech-Ed, SQL Saturday  SQLbits UK.
We will cover the complete upgrade cycle, including the preparation tasks, upgrade tasks, and post-upgrade tasks. Real-world examples from my Consulting experience expanding on why  how such a solution.</description>

      <title>Concurrency Controls and Isolation Levels in SQL Server</title>
      <description>SQL Server determines how multiple processes access the same data simultaneously based on the transaction isolation levels.  Because the locking strategy that the database utilizes to control access to data pages is different between the different isolation level settings, the effects on database performance will also be different.  The right isolation level must be chosen to achieve a good balance between data concurrency and performance.  In this session we will review the isolation level options in SQL Server, their effects on data locks, and performance considerations when running under each of the isolation level.</description>

      <title>How the Grinch Stole SQL Server Performance</title>
      <description>The SQL Server and Data Access frameworks provide developers a rich set of features that help integrating SQL Server as the system database backend in virtually no time. This simplicity, however, often leads to common database design and code mistakes that introduce severe performance issues later when systems work under the heavy load. 

This session shows several common mistakes and inefficiencies that can be found in many production systems such as excessive code reuse in the database using the views and multi-statement functions and in the data access code; unnecessary joins and I/O operations in pagination queries; storage of multiple entities in the same tables using XML for entities-specific attributes; usage of the optional parameters in the where clause of the queries; and several others. The session explains the root-cause of performance issues those mistakes introduce and demonstrates how to properly address them in the code and database design.</description>

My goal is to get you thinking about how your job as DBA or database developer changes when you're part of a team that is striving to release faster. Part of that will be sharing the tool stack I use right now and why, and some of the many challenges I've hit so far.</description>

      <title>Practical Uses for SQL Server 2016 Dynamic Data Masking</title>
      <description>Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) allows database administrators to obfuscate data columns containing sensitive data from unauthorized users without changing the data stored in the database.  This new features has some limitations that prevent it from being used as the only mechanism for securing sensitive data, but it does provide additional flexibility to administrators, developers, and support personnel on querying sensitive data and maintaining compliance.  In this session we will explore how to set up Dynamic Data Masking for use in production support and for generating production-like test data.</description>
