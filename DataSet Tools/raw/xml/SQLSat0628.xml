      <description>I am a recent graduate from Southeastern Louisiana University.  I graduated with 2 degrees, Psychology and Computer Science.  While these two degrees appear to conflict, it has given me a unique look into our the field of software development.  I survived a multitude of internships, from designing web apps to administrating networks.  After trying a multitude of areas in IT, I have settled into the field of software development, more specifically the back-end development of web apps.  I am approaching the end of my first year as a junior developer at Turner Industries.</description>

      <description>I've been solving problems through code with .NET and SQL Server since 2012.  My first jump into this profession was as an LSU IT analyst, where my boss handed over a large code base and said "Go."   During this time, I immensely enjoyed the exposure to tools, techniques, and philosophies of application architecture and database design. I also cultivated a passion for embracing the business domain of any given project - understanding its real value and delivering code with this value continually in mind .
In February 2017, I joined the decidedly awesome team at Envoc as a software developer where I can keep making stuff that makes a difference.</description>

      <title>How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan</title>
      <description>So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.</description>

      <title>Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices from meetings to the board room</title>
      <description>Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Indexes:  Part 2 -- The rest of the story!</title>
      <description>This session is a continuation of my in-memory table presentation (Part 1) given at 8 SQL Saturdays in 2016 only now concentrating on in-memory indexes.  This session will do an in-depth dive into hash, range, and columnstore indexes in the in-memory environment.  It will be about 30% presentation and 70% demos with emphasis on when and how to apply in-memory indexes for stated environments/scenarios.  
After this session you will
1.	 Understand the three in-memory index types, how to create, and when to apply them for selected scenarios
2.	Be able to identify performance gains over equivalent disk back tables/indexes
3.	Comprehend the new data monitoring needed for in-memory tables/indexes</description>

      <title>Programming in Power Query: An Introduction to M</title>
      <description>While the DAX language gets all of the Power BI attention and love, its partner M is nonetheless a powerful workhorse that can be harnessed to do amazing things. We will begin by introducing ourselves to the functional language by building a calendar -- absolutely necessary for all of those lovely DAX time intelligence functions to work. From establishing the time period in question to deciding on what information we need and how we want it presented, our understanding of M will grow as we progress through this construction.

We then look at what to do when the information you get is incomplete and contradictory. Cleaning up data and handling errors and missing data will be our focus in an example of combining multiple data sources into a single data set. We consider this crucial step in the ETL cycle.

Our examination will conclude with a discussion of best practices, centering on coding style and deciding on when to solve a problem with M versus when to rely on DAX.</description>

      <title>Parallel Programming, an Introduction</title>
      <description>CPU clock speeds are growing at a slower rate and one day soon it may reach its physical limitations.  While the speed may be stagnating, the number of cores we have access to is picking up the slack.  While this is great, your code is probably not utilizing more than a single core of processing power!  Parallel programming is the cure to this issue, allowing your code to harness each core and reduce your execution time significantly. The aim of this talk is to give you the basic understanding of parallel programming and some tools in the .NET framework to get you started.

While this is a beginner presentation, it is recommend that you have a firm grasp of coding basics.
The language specific examples will be given in C#.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Statistics – What Are The Chances?</title>
      <description>For far too long, I thought that statistics only contained information on table row counts.  While they do contain that information, there is more to it than that.  In this beginner session, we’ll go over statistics – how they are created, the different types of statistics that exist, how they’re maintained and how the Query Optimizer uses them.  We will also touch on system tables and DMVs that will provide additional information on your statistics.  We'll also go over the cardinality estimator changes in 2014  2016.  At the end of this session, you should have a better idea of how the query optimizer within SQL Server makes decisions on how to gather data.</description>

      <description>The most effective T-SQL support feature comes installed with every edition of SQL Server, is enabled by default, and costs no overhead. Yet, the vast majority of database administrator underutilize or completely neglect it. That feature's name is "comments".
#160;
In this session, Microsoft Certified Master Jennifer McCown will demonstrate the various commenting methods that make code supportable. Attendees will#160;learn what’s important in a header comment, use code blocking to edit code, build a comprehensive help system, and explore alternative comment methods in stored procedures, SSIS packages, SSRS reports, and beyond.#160; These methods help prevent errors and reduce troubleshooting.</description>

      <title>Data Access in Your Code : Thinking Outside the Framework</title>
      <description>Indulge me as I fan the eternal flames of the so-called "impedance mismatch" between your domain objects and the RDBS that stores them. We'll talk about how to augment or even (gasp) forego heavy hitters like Entity Framework when appropriate.  We'll discuss good code design and the merits and trade-offs of interchangeable database implementations.  The presentation will include c#, SQL, EF, SimpleInjector, a dab of Dapper, and my own new secret weapon: FluidDbClient.

You'll find this session helpful if:
- You want to map data to nested domain models of titanium stature (look ma, no public setters!)
- You don't mind getting your c#-coddled hands a little dirty with SQL.
- There are parts of your app where read/write performance is critical 
- You're ready to put some fresh eyes on crusty old terms like Unit of Work, Identity Map, and the Mememto pattern.
- You appreciate things like programming to interfaces, dependency injection, and the subtleties of the Open-Close Principle.</description>

      <title>What’s new for SQL Server Analysis Services?</title>
      <description>So, do we stick with Multidimensional Cubes or move to a Tabular Model? Has DAX functionality improved enough to rely on performance in a Tabular Model? Will we be porting Analysis Services databases to Azure? How do we know what level or pricing model is adequate for an Azure Analysis Service database?
When an Analysis Service database gets created in an enterprise, and users start to report against, it is very hard not to continue to expand the model. Comfort is obtained when a new release of Analysis Services comes along adding functionality to replace the hooks created to satisfy user requirements. With 2016 and 2017, we are seeing the move to update Tabular Models with improved performance and better security. The Multidimensional Cube additions are mainly with new Data Sources and better T-SQL generated to access source databases like Oracle and Teradata.</description>

      <title>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</title>
      <description>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then and begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.</description>

      <description>Data is exploding across enterprises.  Much of it is semi-structured junk.  Or is it junk?  What are you going to do with it until you can find out?  Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  When you are ready, you can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</description>

      <title>Managing SSRS Reports using PowerShell and SSRS Web Services</title>
      <description>When you have to do something more than once, you should script it!  That’s true for SQL Server maintenance tasks.  It’s also important for Business Intelligence projects as well.  Microsoft has provided web services to manage your reporting service and to download reports in various forms.  In this session I demonstrate how to leverage these web services from PowerShell to handle common SSRS administrative tasks:  uploading and copying a report; checking the parameter values, setting the parameter defaults, scheduling a cache refresh.  I addition, I demonstrate how to download a report top PDF using PowerShell.  You will not only come away with a set of PowerShell scripts to manage your SSRS server, you will learn how to work around some of the less intuitive features of PowerShell to use and extend these scripts.</description>

      <title>Using a gateway to leverage on-premises data in Power BI</title>
      <description>I look at how you can take advantage of an on-premises gateway to make use of local data when creating reports and dashboards for Power BI. This will start with Power BI Desktop, and the choices you have for SQL Server and Analysis Services. It will then move to the cloud and look at hosting your files on OneDrive for Business, and what this means for data freshness. We will then look at options for personal use or a more centralized use. It will finish off with looking at some troubleshooting tools available to you when working with data refresh.</description>

      <title>Bringing DevOps to the Database</title>
      <description>DevOps is a hot topic in today's software development world. However most of the knowledge and experience with DevOps is based around application software and ignores the database. We will examine how the concepts and principles of DevOps can be applied to database development by looking at both automated comparison analysis as well as migration script management. Automated building, testing, and deployment of database changes will be shown.</description>

      <title>Set Me Up: How to Think in Sets</title>
      <description>SQL Server is optimized to work in sets, but this is certainly a paradigm shift for someone accustomed to row-by-row operations.

We will look at T-SQL features that can break set-based processing -- generally meaning poor performance -- and gather empirical evidence to support that assertion.  We'll also look at some constructs to overcome these issues and make your T-SQL scripts run faster and use fewer resources.</description>

      <title>Async or Parallel? No they aren't the same thing!</title>
      <description>I have frequently seen developers confuse async and parallel programming, not understanding that the purpose of each are quite different.  Well designed modern .NET development is full of the async/await model,  async/await is built on the Task model, but also async is not parallel.  So understanding these concepts is key to long term success in building apps in .NET that are both responsive and most efficient.</description>

      <description>With React Native, you don't build a “mobile web app”, an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app”. You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.</description>

      <title>Exploring the All-New SSRS 2016</title>
      <description>For years, SQL Server Reporting Services chugged along with very few updates. Although it remained a reliable and popular reporting tool, the feature set largely remained unchanged for a decade. With the release of SQL Server 2016, everything changed. Microsoft delivered a brand new SSRS. This session will review and demonstrate the new features of SQL Server Reporting Services 2016. You'll walk through the essential changes in SSRS, from the new report manager to the new visualizations. You'll also discuss the SSRS ecosystem and how it fits together with PowerBI and other Microsoft reporting/analytics platforms.</description>

      <title>Weird stuff I saw ... while supporting a Java team</title>
      <description>After spending more than a decade completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I did some time supporting a Java team. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. But it is a different stack, different culture, and different group of folks giving bad advice to developers ... just enough different to keep life interesting. Come hear about my misadventures with server side cursors, output parameters, integrated authentication, and NOCOUNT settings.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting SQL Server Performance</title>
      <description>Microsoft SQL Support Engineers troubleshoot performance issues all day, every day.  They use a set of tools that not only gather all the data necessary to troubleshoot any performance issue, but the tools also analyze the data and generate visually attractive reports. These tools have been available to the public for free for years.  This presentation explains the tools, how to run them and how to interpret the results, including how to determine disk latency root cause, top reasons for high cpu, and what to do when you have excessive waits.</description>

      <description>Heard of .NET Core, but not taken the time to look in to it? Started looking at it, but been discouraged by the seemingly endless stream of breaking changes to the architecture? Played around with it, but want to know what the framework code you're typing is actually doing? This talk aims to answer some of your questions about .NET Core, what it is, how it's structured, middleware, and the differences between it and the .NET Framework. We'll also have a brief introduction to ASP.NET Core.</description>

      <description>"With the release of SQL Server 2016, Microsoft has included two features that could fundamentally change the way we look at Data Warehousing.  The addition of Polybase for connecting to external data sources such as Hadoop and Azure Blob for native TSQL queries extends the reach of the DW.   In this session we will discuss how to configure Polybase, best use cases, as well as live demos of the technology.</description>
