      <description>For over 15 years Shannon Lowder has been spotting patterns and learning ways to work smarter instead of harder. He started with development and moved into database administration. Using TSQL, Database Jobs and PowerShell, he automated himself out of contracts quickly.  As Business Intelligence became a greater demand, he moved into SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS development.  Early on, he tried using PowerShell and .Net to automate BI Development. Later those efforts turned to Biml.  After founding a startup six years ago, he finds himself a data platform consultant, designing and guiding other professionals to build highly automated enterprise solutions.  Today, he is a Biml Hero candidate and is awaiting the final approval for the award.</description>

      <description>As a DBA for 15 years, I have a wide and varied experience in most industries and sizes of companies.  My experience with SQL Server ranges from version 6.5 through version 2016.

I have two BS degrees in Chemistry and Biology and an MS in Cybersecurity.  My favorite part of this career is the opportunity to learn something new everyday and share that knowledge with others.  The opportunity to mentor other DBAs over the years has also been a enriching part of my career.  Mentoring is another reason I love being a DBA.</description>

      <description>I have been in IT since 1999, starting with Exchange Server.  From there I moved into System Center.  Now I work with Kelverion in a role that is both Engineering and Sales combined.  I also manage our relationship with Microsoft and our Federal Customers.  With Kelverion and the use of our SQL Integration Tools, I have been able to make Automation easier using a backend SQL Database to "persist" data.  Orchestrator does not do this out of the box, everything exists in memory.  Using Kelverion' s SQL methodology I am able to use a small SQL DB to integrate automation with multiple 3rd Party software tools into ITSM.</description>

      <title>Increase Your Coding Speed in SQL Server Management Studio</title>
      <description>Every developer wants to be productive and get more things accomplished during their day to day work. Given a choice between working harder and working smarter, you will most likely choose the latter. But the big question is – How do you boost your productivity? How do you reduce your development time? How do you increase your coding speed?

Be it a T-SQL developer or DBA, we spend most of our time working in SQL Server Management Studio. In this session, we will learn a number of tips and tricks to increase productivity and efficiency in SSMS IDE. We will also look at the new and improved features of SSMS 2016. We will learn how adding few free third party tools to the SSMS IDE will enhance your coding speed. This will be a content rich session with plenty of live demonstrations.

By the end of this session, you will learn some useful techniques to take back with you and apply in your day to day work.</description>

      <title>SELECT Provider FROM Cloud</title>
      <description>Are you starting to think that this cloud thing may actually take off?  Perhaps it has become your responsibility to look for a cloud provider to meet the data needs of your employer/client or you want to be ready in case someone asks.  In this session, we will spend a few moments defining Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) before moving on to a brief discussion regarding cloud objections and misconceptions.  Finally, we reach our destination, a conversation based in the classic high school essay test question “Compare and Contrast” concerning data centric services in AWS and Azure.  The focus of this session is available features not necessarily how to use them.</description>

      <title>Query Store Primer</title>
      <description>This session will take a look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse. We will take a hands on look at how to use Query Store to troubleshoot problems as well as some of the new DMVs you can use to find issues as they arise.</description>

      <title>Using SQL as the Key to Robust Automation</title>
      <description>Kelverion Best Practices; Using a Persistent Data Store

It is Kelverion’s recommendation that in nearly every case runbook automations be implemented utilizing a small backend SQL database table or set of tables. This document explains why we make this recommendation.

Persistence

The ORCHESTRATOR data bus is extremely powerful but it is not persistent. This means that if the ORCHESTRATOR runbook server were to reboot or the services were to crash all data about executing runbooks would be lost. So a complicated multistep workflow that is counting on the data bus for its current state would need to be restarted manually by an administrator. That administrator would potentially need to take significant time to understand what parts of the workflow had run successfully and what parts were still needed. If a persistent data store is used at the backend, the last successful step in the process has been recorded in the database with all necessary information to continue the next step.</description>

      <title>Where Does R Fit Into Your SQL Server Stack?</title>
      <description>Now that SQL Server 2016 includes support for R in the database, how does this change your BI implementation options?

In this session, we start with a brief introduction to R and explain why it’s increasingly popular, the typical development workflow, which tools you can use, common use cases, and where it fits into the latest Microsoft stack at a high level.

Then we’ll review how to implement R Services so that you can use R with SQL Server data, including how to install R packages on SQL Server, how to use rx functions, and how to operationalize R in SQL Server.

Then we explore options for using R to prepare data for analytics using SSIS or Power BI and how to report and visualize data using SSRS or Power BI.</description>

      <title>Handling Temporal Data in SQL Server 2016</title>
      <description>In many industries, it is necessary for data professionals to be able to show what a data set looked like at a previous point in time. Whether it's calculating tax or insurance rates based on a contract date, quickly comparing data changes over time for trend analysis or just recovering from an accidental data change, it's useful to be able to look back in time through our data. Solutions like Change Data Capture or trigger-based audit tables can be slow, or require a lot of extra code to be effective. Fortunately, SQL Server 2016 introduces system-versioned tables, also known as Temporal Tables, which track data through time with far less overhead than other solutions. In this session, you'll learn how to create temporal tables, how SQL Server manages data within those tables, and how to query data at a specific point in time using several real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints</title>
      <description>Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.</description>

      <title>Securing SQL Server</title>
      <description>A default SQL Server installation is reasonably secure, but quot;reasonably securequot; doesn#39;t cut it in an era in which one bad line of code, one weak password, or one open port can result in your customer database ending up on Pastebin. In this talk, we will look at different methods of securing a SQL Server instance, from venerable (principle of least privilege, Transparent Data Encryption) to novel (Always Encrypted, row-level security). These tools and techniques will show us ways for developers, database administrators, and network specialists to work together to secure SQL Server instances.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wanted to know how Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) works or how you set it up? What about encrypting your backups? This session will go over all the steps and caveats that go with this technology. TDE allows you to have your database encrypted on disk and the same Encryption Hierarchy allows you to back up your database and have it encrypt the contents in the backup file.  We will discuss the Encryption Hierarchy which is used for encryption in SQL Server and take you through keeping your secrets safe. We will also go over how Always Encrypted works as well. Master the concepts of SQL Server Encryption when you are done with this session.</description>

      <title>From SQL to DAX – another way of extract data</title>
      <description>Summary: This presentation is to provide BI consultants and SQL developers with different DAX and tabular modeling solutions which can be replacements of SQL querying and high resource consuming ETL processes.
Abstract:
Many of us are coming from knowing SQL before they have been introduced with DAX or many of us know how to use tabular model through reporting tool but do not know they can use DAX as query language against a tabular model. 
Thus, I am glad to provide this presentation focusing on three areas:
1. How to use DAX as a query language to select columns (columns from multiple tables and from value); Group Data; Filter Data; Join Tables; Build customized calculations/measures 
2. How to use tracing tools to monitor the performance difference between SQL solution and DAX solution;
3. Use  a real life example to demonstrate how to DAX and tabular modeling  (Row Contexts vs. Filter Contexts+Bridge Table+Inactive relationship+extended table) to replace high resource ETL Processes</description>

      <title>SQL into R: an Absolute Beginners' Guide to R for the SQL User</title>
      <description>SQL data can be exported to any number of data manipulation, visualization, and reporting packages, including R. But what, exactly, is R and why would anyone consider it when there are already so many other choices available? We will answer those questions by considering: (1) what is R? (2) how does it work? (3) why is it so popular (4) what is so special about it?
We will do this using side-by-side examples of R and SQL code, and by using the "pipe" operator in R to connect several operations to analyze a publicly-available data set. By the end of this session, the attendees will have the previous questions answered and be able to decide whether to consider R, or to stay with their current solution.</description>

      <title>How to Keep Your Databases Secure in Just Minutes a Day</title>
      <description>You’re busy. You don’t have time to check the security of your systems all the time, right? It’s not like anyone has added a user that you don’t know about. And no one would create a database and add all logins to the db_owner role. And of course, no one would ever think of setting the TRUSTWORTHY property on a database... right?

Things like that happen on a daily basis, poking holes in even the most well-secured database. Those holes are just waiting for someone to find them. That someone could be you, or it could be an attacker probing for a way to get data from your company.

In this session, we will explore how to create reports that are quick to review so you can find the holes before someone else does - without interfering with the rest of your day. Along the way, you'll also learn where to find security-related information in SQL Server's metadata and logs to allow you to customize and extend the reports to meet your company's unique needs.</description>

      <title>45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model</title>
      <description>Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the new Azure Analysis Services product? Or you've looked at these and like what they can add in Power BI or classic BI scenarios, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure all of this out? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new-ish form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various options for deployment, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Transaction</title>
      <description>In SQL Server, the transaction log is the most important file in any database.  All changes to the data and schema are tracked in the transaction log.  Join me to learn how to read the transaction log, how to follow a transaction as is processes, and how SQL Server handles a transaction rollback.  You will also learn how to identify the resources and objects SQL Server accesses during the course of the transaction.  Finally, you will see how SQL Server processes transactions for In-Memory tables.</description>

      <title>The Data-Professional’s Junk Drawer</title>
      <description>There is at least one in your home right now, a box, a basket, a bucket, perhaps even actually drawer; hastily organized at best but full of tools, gadgets, widgets and whatchamacallits designed for one or two specific purposes.  Realistically, we all want to use the more generic, multipurposed item found in our “well organized place for storing things”, yet deep down we know that tool/gadget/widget etc. is really what we need.  As data-professionals, we are all familiar with the largest “junk drawer” ever created, the Internet.  In this session, we will discuss some tools which are not data specific, the jobs they do well, and where to find them.  Join as us as explore Robocopy, parts of the SysInterals Suite, a connection manager or two, portables apps aplenty and more so that you can move that file more efficiently, troubleshoot that problem through a different lens, or simply know what the heck someone else is talking about.</description>

      <description>Ethics, Morals, and Laws each govern one aspect of our behavior as people and DBAs. They govern which actions we take and which actions we avoid.

Understanding the basics of these guides and how they coordinate (and sometimes conflict) with each other helps you to make choices you can live with from both a personal and professional perspective.

This session presents basic definitions, ideas, and discussion points. It is intended to be an interactive presentation where the audience contributes to the discussion, so no two presentations are exactly the same!</description>

      <description>SQL Server 2016 is packed with many great features. One of those features is the integration of R in SQL Server via SQL Server R Services. This integration gives us the ability to perform very sophisticated analytics against data inside the database and data warehoused in big data environments such as Spark  Hadoop. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to productionize models developed by your data scientist via SQL Server R Services. I will demonstrate how to manage the whole process using an IDE that many of us have grown to love, Visual Studio.</description>

In this session we'll look into why having multiple files for databases and filegroups is important, even on solid state drives.  Then we'll look into some scripts and tools that will assist us in transforming our databases to be right-sized for performance considerations.</description>

      <title>Availablity Groups in SQL 2016 and beyond: Faster, Higher, Stronger</title>
      <description>Always On Availability Groups have become the preferred HA/DR solution within SQL Server. Starting with SQL Server 2016, a number of enhancements have been made to make AGs faster, have better up time, and be more resilient.    We will cover all the recent changes in Availability Groups (direct seeding, multiple automatic failover replicas, distributed AGs, load balanced secondaries, etc) and look at how they can be leveraged to create more robust HA/DR solutions.</description>

      <description>Having multiple data visualizations doesn't make it easier to choose the right one to reveal the story. Choosing the wrong visualization can obscure the story - or worse yet, distort it! In this session, learn the vocabulary of data visualization and how to apply grammar (visualization design principles) to your data. Along the way, you will also learn how to evaluate the goal of your data story and how to choose the correct visualizations that communicate this story accurately and effectively.</description>
