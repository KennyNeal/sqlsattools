When I started at a company with a great, knowledgeable manager and learned to find others speaking about SQL Server online my skills boomed.  This is especially true in my most passionate area, SQL Server performance.  

Knowing that my knowledge came from others, I now have a second passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</description>

      <title>Refresh a 1TB+ database in under 10 seconds</title>
      <description>The presentation covers recoverability options in SQL Server over time.  It will take us through many different ways of recovering a large 1TB+ database.  It will also walk us through many different options for creating development/test/uat environments.  It will highlight the benefits and shortcomings of these options while delivering a business value of each.  It will also evaluate a high level ROI of each of these options.
Finally, the presentation will focus on an architecture based on SAN technologies with respect to SQL Server.  I will demonstrate an architecture put in place resolving many business needs in a financial trading environment, working with large data sets and many different environments.   This section will highlight the benefits of using SQL Server together with newer SAN solutions and show the potential for reliability, scalability, and the delivery of a high quality HA/DR solution. That is where things get interesting...</description>

      <title>DBA 102: Now What</title>
      <description>Things happened, you got a knock on the head and when you awoke your boss said “congratulations” you are our new DBA, perhaps you came to the role in a more intentional manner or are just DBA curious.  Your environment is running but you are wondering “now what” or “what’s next”.  In this session we will give an overview of a few things that could, perhaps even should be next and give some recommendations as to where you can find more resources on-line and maybe even suggest a few sessions to attend at this very SQL Saturday.  So, what will be covered, recovery strategy (you think I mean backups, I don’t, you’ll see why), a touch on performance tuning with a hint of indexing thrown in, add a pinch of high availability and a smattering of security all of which will give you some idea how to answer “now what”.</description>

      <title>Got stress?  Sometimes the SQL Server needs some too</title>
      <description>We hear it in every session and every webinar “…test…” regardless of it being upgrades, new code, performance tuning or any of a thousand changes.  Once we confirm nothing breaks., we don’t need to check anything else, nothing could possibly change the results, right?  What about load on the database(s) in question or the server as a whole?  In this session four readily available tools, distributed replay, Hammer DB, SQL Query Stress and oStress will be introduced.  The session will cover how to use the tools as well as which situations they shine in.  Once introductions are made, we will spend a little time with two of my favorites, HammerDB and SQL Query Stress.  Join me as we apply a little heat to our SQL Servers.</description>

      <title>DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016</title>
      <description>The war between DBAs and developers has been raging since the dawn of relational databases. One reason for disagreement comes from developers who want to store their data in JSON because it is fast, standard, and flexible. DBAs cringe when they hear of long text strings being stored in their SQL databases; they cry with concern, “No data validation? No schema binding?”. Is there any hope for these two warring factions to see eye-to-eye?

This session will explore the new JSON functionality introduced in SQL Server 2016. We will use T-SQL examples to learn how these functions can be used to parse, create, and modify JSON data. More importantly, we will discuss how to optimize performance when using these functions.

By the end of this session DBAs and developers will know how to efficiently work with JSON in SQL Server 2016. It will also usher in an era of peace between DBAs and developers…

… at least until someone brings up the topics of cursors, NOLOCKs, or Entity Framework.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Melee: AWS vs Azure</title>
      <description>The world is drowning in data and there’s a gold rush in the business of turning data into actionable insight. In one corner, stands AWS, a long time cloud services innovator, that wants to leverage its PaaS dominance to take it into the next decade. In the other corner, stands a scrappy re-invigorated Microsoft with a new focus on making the cloud smarter.

Both are feverishly working on creating compelling solutions for developers to build intelligent solutions upon. Is one better than the other? What are each one’s strengths and weaknesses?

And what does Google have up its sleeve?

Come to this session to get a first hand account of a former Microsoft evangelist now working at an AWS partner startup, who promises to keep it a good clean fight!</description>

      <title>Cross Tabs  Pivots - Much More Than Just Converting Rows to Columns</title>
      <description>This session covers and compares the PIVOT operator to an ancient but very high performance pivoting method known as CROSS TABs.  Single and double column pivots will be covered and the “secret” to quickly making CROSS TABs is “Copy’n’Paste” easy.  We’ll also introduce a couple of “Black Arts” techniques called “Pre-Aggregation” and “Divide’n’Conquer” to build a quarterly report for 1 year from 10 years and 10 MILLION rows of data in just half a second.

If time allows, we’ll also discover that you can very quickly format reports as pretty as you’ll see in SSRS without using SSRS.

Don't let the "Intermediate" rating of this session scare you beginners away because we start at the ground floor and work our way up to some very high performance code.  Even if you already know how to use PIVOT or CROSS TABs, you won’t want to miss this one.</description>

      <title>Geo Location of Twitter messages in Power BI</title>
      <description>There are several custom solutions that make Twitter messages analysis possible in Power BI. And with a recent addition of the Campaign/Brand Management for Twitter solution template for Power BI (https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-templates/brand-management-twitter/) it's getting even less complicated to get into this social media mainstream data exploration.

This solution has several components:
- Logic App passes tweet into an Azure Function
- Azure Function enriches tweet and writes it to Azure SQL
- Azure Function also calls Azure ML experiment running Python script to work out sentiment of tweet
- Power BI imports data into it from Azure SQL and renders pre-defined reports

However, Geo location for twitter messages is not available (if we want to filter them by a particular country). Let's try to explore with live demos if we can customize this Azure solution and add a Country filter to our Power BI reports based on live tweet data.</description>

      <title>Stop Doing That! Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns</title>
      <description>There are several programming design patterns that work great in object oriented code but do not scale  inside SQL Server. Things like Scalar-Value functions, Unions, CTEs, and row by row processing can make for more work then you would expect.

In this session, we will focus on several anti-patterns like these and show how to rework them to improve scale in the database engine.   

By the end of the session, you will be able to quickly identify these common anti-patterns and analyze their sometimes unclear cost to the engine. Heading back to the office, you’ll be able to identify pain points in your longest running queries from a T-SQL perspective and become a code tuning rockstar!</description>

      <title>Does This Look Weird?  The Importance Of Baselining</title>
      <description>How do you know when your server is on fire?  Without a set of known-good measurements to compare against, you don’t.  This session will show you how to capture a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance and help you decide what to capture, and where to store it. Finally we will put it all together by walking through a scenario using the captured baseline data to identify a problem.</description>

      <title>Access, Users, Permissions for Beginners!</title>
      <description>Who, What, and Why are important when allowing access to anything in SQL server. Who needs the access, why they need it, and what they will be doing with it, are key factors to think about when assigning permissions. Join me in learning about the different levels of permissions allowed in SQL server, from the server level to the database level and more. You will leave with a better idea and plan of how to say “NO” to that one developer that NEEDS sysadmin access.</description>

      <description>What are indexes and how does SQL Server use them?  Discuss the types of indexes that are available, and go in depth into heaps, clustered indexes and nonclustered indexes.  Why does SQL Server choose an index, and how does it make your queries run faster?  If you're a good fit to be in this session then columnstore, hash, and XML indexes aren't a good fit for you, so they will not get much more than an honorable mention.</description>

      <description>We all know that backups are important. But are we building a backup strategy that can recover in a manner that meets business needs? All too often, we plan a backup strategy without a recovery strategy.

In this session, veteran DBA Mike Hillwig will start with understanding the recovery strategy and work toward implementing the right backups to meet that recovery strategy.  He'll also set the record straight around some very common myths around database recovery and backups.</description>

      <title>SQL Server on Linux for SQL DBA.</title>
      <description>For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.</description>

I will use T-SQL script to generate script to compress each tables and release the free space by shrinking the datafiles.
And in the final I will defragment the indexes and update the statistics, since shrink datafile is not fragmentation aware task.</description>

      <description>You know it's coming . . . one day soon, you'll be asked to take ownership of a database that uses In-Memory OLTP. Then what?

Deploying In-Memory OLTP affects the database ecosystem, including monitoring, data migration, logging, capacity planning, backup, restore, recovery, and more.

DBAs need to know optimal methods of migrating large data sets from disk to In-Memory, the differences between restore and recovery for memory-optimized databases, and many other facets of the In-Memory world.  

Attendees will gain a clear understanding of the knowledge and skills required to administer In-Memory OLTP environments.</description>

This presentation will show you how to detect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator; how to find the statement that causes conversion, and what DMVs can help to solve the problem. It will also show you the solution to collect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator across the servers.</description>

      <title>SSIS Incremental Loading:  The Tortoise and The Hare</title>
      <description>Extracting, transforming and loading data has become a major component to satisfying business requirements and needs.  Depending on the size of the data you are working with, the way you design your SSIS packages can have an impact on performance and run times.  

In this session, we will cover a variety of incremental design approaches centered around large data sets using SSIS.  We will look at the architecture of each ETL strategy to determine the pros and cons and generate specific use cases to decide which strategy yields optimal results.</description>
