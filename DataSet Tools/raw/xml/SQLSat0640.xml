      <description>Mickey Stuewe has been working with SQL Server since 6.5. That gives her over 20 years of experience. She has not only been a database developer, but also an application developer, even before Visual Studio existed. She is now thankful to be focusing on database design, t-SQL development, and query optimization. She also has a habit of enjoying SSIS and data warehouse design.

She blogs regularly on her website mickeystuewe.com and contributes to sites such as SQL Server Central and SQL Server Pro. She enjoys presenting at PASS Summit, SQL Saturdays, User Groups and other events.

When she is not immersed in SQL related activities, she enjoys action movies, art, reading, and laughing. She laughs loudly and often...just ask her children.</description>

      <description>Neil Weicher is the Founder and CTO of NetLib Security Inc, an early pioneer driving data encryption since 1990. Mr. Weicher was working in computer engineering in the late 1980s when he noticed companies compiling massive amounts of sensitive information on their databases but leaving it all unprotected. This spurred him to create what is now NetLib Security's flagship data security platform, Encryptionizer; encryption for Windows and SQL across the enterprise.

Mr. Weicher holds a patent for a system for encrypting data files of application programs. He received a Master of Science in Computer Science from Columbia University.</description>

      <title>Mastering Master Data Services</title>
      <description>As your organization grows, one challenge will be the management of data between systems and organizational units. With MDS, Microsoft provides the ability to have one accurate source of non-transactional data. This data can then be used within applications, other databases, and ETL processes. By leveraging data stewards to help manage the data repository, you can ensure that your MDS data is always up-to-date and accurate.

In this presentation we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this presentation, you will have a good understanding of what master data management is, what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.</description>

      <description>In-Memory OLTP (code name: Hekaton) is the most important new feature in SQL Server 2014, and this session will teach you how query processing and optimization work with this new database engine. After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of users constantly coming to you for data?  Would like to be able to quickly and easily enable your uses to go get the data themselves?  Do you simply not have the budget/executive buy-in to purchase a BI solution?  In this session you will see how easy this often overlooked and underutilized feature of SQL Server is to use.  The session will start with a quick overview of some reporting examples followed by a live demo that will cover the basics of developing, publishing and using an SSRS report.  It will cover all aspects of report creation from connecting to the data source through putting the data on the page and publishing to the report server.  You will learn how to use this powerful feature of SQL Server that can relieve you from data delivery tasks and thrill your end users.  Return to the office and present meaningful data to your end users with minimal time and effort with the tips learned in this session.</description>

      <title>Architecting virtual SQL server for performance</title>
      <description>Today, many organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by the author of the official SQL server on VMware best practices guide.</description>

      <title>Upgrades  Rollbacks for SQL Server</title>
      <description>Are you facing a big SQL Server upgrade but are not quite sure how you will tackle it?  In this presentation we will discuss what we learned during our 2008 R2 upgrade to SQL 2014.  We will go through how we met our RTO, RCO, rollback, testing, and actual cutover process. 

We will utilize setting up and testing mirroring to move the data from 2008 to 2014. We will migrate the IP of the old 2008 cluster to the new 2014 cluster.  This way no clients change their connection strings as DNS is not an option in this environment.  Trans Replication will be set for rollback to the 2008 cluster in case we need to after going live.  We will use the 'no init' option as we do not have time to create a snapshot and will protect the data during the upgrade to ensure no writes are conducted.

Scripts and a background on transaction replication will be provided to show the end user how to start testing this process in their environment.  Pre-cutover and Post-cutover tasks will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>What, When and Why, a particular database technology (relational or non-relational) to use</title>
      <description>With availability of many choices for database technologies, developer/architect tend to make wrong selection of database systems that helps solving problem for short term but does become problem in long term. Most of these problems are result of not knowing What, When and Why to use a particular database systems but starts using it because they know, how to use it or it looks fascinating or others are using it.

      <title>Continuous Integration for Databases</title>
      <description>Building software is hard, and we often find that fixing bugs is expensive if they are not caught early. Continuous Integration has proven to be a valuable technique in improving software quality by finding problems quickly and letting developers know immediately they have introduced a bug.This session demonstrates how you can implement CI for SQL Server databases, execute automated tests against your code and inform developers that they have caused a problem immediately.</description>

      <title>Are You Optimistic About Concurrency?</title>
      <description>What exactly does it mean to have optimistic concurrency? What is the alternative? Is SQL Server 2012's SNAPSHOT Isolation optimistic? How can SQL Server 2014’s In-Memory OLTP provide truly optimistic concurrency? In this session, we’ll look at what guarantees the various isolation levels provide, the difference between pessimistic and optimistic concurrency, and the new data structures in SQL Server 2014 that allow the enormous benefits of having all your data totally in-memory with no waiting for I/O or locks!</description>

      <title>SQL Server AGs and Clustering In The Cloud</title>
      <description>This session is to help you see how straight forward it is to create a test environment in AWS and Azure utilizing the features provided by Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC).  We will create both an instance level Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) and a 2014 Availability Group (AG) with a read-only replica node.   We will show how to setup IPs, iSCSI devices, default AD setup, and SQL Server installations.  Some basic Powershell will be used and the code made available if needed.

iSCSI will be created using a 'Storage Gateway' on AWS and another solution such as DataKeeper for Microsoft Azure.

Ultimately these environments will allow you to quickly spin up machines and begin to look at State Configuration solutions such as 'Microsoft DSC' or for example, utilizing the SALT stack.</description>

      <title>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</title>
      <description>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</description>

      <title>Amazon Aurora - A New Dawn in the World of Relational Database Engines</title>
      <description>Amazon Aurora is the result of being asked this question by Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO  the person responsible for the conception of AWS: "In a world where AWS exists, how would you re-design the relational database?"  What the data team came up with is a whole new paradigm shift: they built a service-oriented  decoupled architecture applied to a database engine.

Aurora has 5x the throughput comparable to enterprise commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. It’s built on AWS for the cloud, it's self-managing  self-healing. You can perform 6M inserts  30M selects per minute, scaling out further via Read Replicas. Storage automatically grows storage up to 64 TB, and more. 

Come hear about the hottest new AWS RDS database, its unique architecture and features, and learn why it's known as an "RDS Game Changer"!</description>

      <title>The Optimizer Secrets of 860X</title>
      <description>Debugging SQL using the 8600 Series of Trace Flags: You already know a thing or two about tuning a SQL query on Microsoft SQL Server. You can read an execution plan and know the most significant red flags to look for. And you have also learned about the important information revealed by SET STATISTICS statements. But you want to take it up another level! In this session, go even deeper with query tuning with three new lessons. First, we’ll examine a few new and seldom used features inside of SSMS specifically for query performance. Second, we’ll spend a bit of time learning query related DMVs and how to read query plans in directly within XML. Finally, we will discuss and demo a set of powerful Trace Flags, the 8600 series, that reveal additional details about how the query optimizer behaves as it processes a query.</description>

      <description>When doing agile development, whether you have 1 production target database or in case of a SaaS solution, multiple targets, database change management becomes extremely crucial. One of the challenges with traditional SSDT projects are that they work on the "as-is" model through the development cycle and obfuscate the details of how actual changes would be applied. In this session, we will look at how to use the RedGate tools now available inside Visual Studio 2017 to manage the development process and gain better control over your deployments. 

This session will cover my experiences, tips and tricks with managing a Cloud SaaS solution and we will look at how Visual Studio 2017 and the RedGate family of tools provide tremendous value and higher confidence with our product releases.</description>

      <title>Why are you still taking backups?</title>
      <description>Keep doing things the same way because they have always worked in the past is a very comfortable mistake we all make in many areas. That includes backup strategies and service account administration. In this one hour presentation full of demos I will explore many options available in SQL Server 2016 and Azure that can potentially reduce the amount of data and time required for backups and even eliminate the need all together. It sounds scary but it will be really fun.</description>

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

      <title>The SQL Server v.Next Availability Story on Linux</title>
      <description>Although the paint on SQL Server 2016 just finished drying, Microsoft is already working on v.Next and preview builds are already available. One of the biggest changes is that SQL Server will be supported on Linux in addition to Windows Server. This means that all of the considerations we have for deploying instances and databases will be relevant and possibly different on Linux. While the story is still a work in progress, this session will cover how SQL Server v.Next can be made available based on what is known at this time. If you want to get a head start with SQL Server on Linux, this session is for you.</description>

      <title>Who needs numbers? Enhance your data models and dashboards with Non-Numeric measures</title>
      <description>We don't really think of putting text, date or boolean values in the measures of our pivot tables or on our dashboards, but after this session, hopefully you will. 

Enhance the functionality of your SSAS Tabular and PowerBI output, by understanding HOW-, WHY- and WHEN to leverage the power of DAX to create non-numeric measures, and see how you can quickly help business answer a number of different questions, by thinking differently about where measures start and end.</description>
