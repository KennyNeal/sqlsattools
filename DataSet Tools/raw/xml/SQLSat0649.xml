      <description>Over 15 years of Information Technology experience with the last 12 years focused on mastering the Microsoft SQL
Server platform including Power BI and data Science algorithms.
My diverse background of hands-on experience has resulted in a strong foundation of SQL Server knowledge, a mastery of the art of architect, managing and maintain very large scale of databases (2TB+ transnational). My background of administrating financial, healthcare, mortgage, and retails data makes me very unique database administer to work with. 

My overall experience and exposure to the IT infrastructure like virtualization, SAN planning and monitoring and understanding of advance networking concepts really compliments my dba skillset.

      <description>After 10 years in the United States Air Force as a linguist, I decided to go into the world of computing.  I graduated from the University of North Florida with a Bachelor of Science in Computing  Info Sciences. Before graduating, I completed a yearlong internship with an excellent company  where I learned how important it was to teach myself and follow my passions.  As a .Net programmer my biggest surprise was how interested I was in database development.  My current interest is getting information to decision makers as fast and easy as possible.  From conceptual and logical data models to physical implementation, I want to get the right information to the right people with as little technological effort as possible.</description>

      <title>Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!</title>
      <description>Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.</description>

      <description>In its origin, Hadoop was created as a distributed computing system designed to process data in batches, but the many advantages of the platform lead to an immediate desire to run interactive analytical queries against Data Lakes built on Hadoop.  So a few years back the Stinger initiative was created as an ongoing effort to bring interactive SQL querying capabilities to Hive, and its latest release has finally delivered! 
In this session, Luis Figueroa (Solutions Engineer @ Hortonworks) will walk you through the latest advancements that make Hadoop a powerful SQL engine that expands you EDW capabilities with unlimited scale and amazing flexibility. Luis will provide a technical overview of the Hive engine, an update on SQL compatibility with the ANSI standard,  real world use cases and a live demo. If you are a data pro this session is for you!</description>

      <description>Stagnancy in learning and personal growth often leads to frustration and undesired stress.  It is vital to our everyday success that we seek to not only better ourselves through professional and personal development, but it is just as critical to ensure the methods we are using to absorb this content are effectively presented and better suit our learning abilities.  

I believe the question we need to answer, is not what we're learning, but rather how do we best learn?  In this session, we will discuss three popular training methods and how we can customize these options to best fit our needs.

This session will help the attendees better prepare themselves for Learning Development and will motivate the attendees to take action.</description>

      <title>DevOps for the DBA</title>
      <description>DevOps came out of the Agile movement and the idea that operations needed to be part of the solution for agile development to be successful.  The DBA was often the most resilient and robust member of the operations team and most resistant to change.  This mentality was essential to the protection of company’s critical production data.

This session discusses common database challenges and how they can be minimized or solved with newer DevOps practices without impacting the DBAs “safe zone”.  We’ll discuss how to use these vital skills and motivate everyone towards solutions for more success in agile development environments. Development, testing, provisioning, patching, upgrading and managing will become easier with agile tools, virtualization and collaboration.  
The take-aways from this session are to embrace DevOps basics with a “DBA twist” such as:
•	Develop, Rinse, Repeat
•	Test Until Your Five Year Old Can Do It
•	Human Intervention Creates Human Error- Automate EVERYTHING.</description>

      <title>Handling Late Arriving Dimension Records in a Datawarehouse using SSIS/SQL</title>
      <description>Data Warehouse Theory can be a tough nut to crack.  A late arriving dimension record tends to occur when you receive a fact record before the dimension record arrives in the data warehouse so you must create a placeholder record.

In this session, we will give you a brief overview of Facts and Dimensions, and then do an in-depth discussion on what late arriving dimension records are, why they are important, and how to handle them.  We will explain how not properly handling these can negatively affect your Financial Reports.  We will also cover how to correct those records in the data warehouse once the proper dimension record arrives on the doorstep of the data warehouse.</description>

      <title>Cautionary Tale of Recompilations, Excessive CPU Load and Plan Caching</title>
      <description>SQL Server reduces compilation and optimization overhead by caching and reusing execution plans for the queries. Plan caching helps to reduce CPU load on the server; however, it may also introduce unexpected issues and lead to suboptimal execution plans and performance problems.  

In this session, Dmitri will explain how plan caching works internally and demonstrate how to address several common issues related to the plan caching. He will talk about parameter sniffing, simple and forced parameterization, OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN strategy, and several other related topics.    Finally, Dmitri will provide the guidelines how to reduce CPU load and recompilation overhead in the systems with heavy ad-hoc workload and non-parameterized queries.</description>

      <title>Tell the story with Power BI visualizations embedded in your web site based on Azure Data</title>
      <description>Honey, Let Me Drive!  
See how husband and wife tech team, Steve and Susan Schneider, set up a Florida traffic database in Azure and build dynamic interactive presentations using Power BI, without killing each other or ‘driving’ each other crazy!  
In this fast pace seminar, you’ll get a quick overview of how to set up an Azure database and move data to Azure; then it’s off for a road trip with Power BI.  Using Power BI visualizations, we’ll answer some questions like:
1-	What color of vehicle is most likely to be in an accident
2-	What make and model get into crashes most often
3-	What counties in Florida have the highest amount of accidents?  Hint:  It is not Duval!
4-	Do more accidents really happen on one day of the week over another day?
And much more!
Come along on this trip to see how you can stand up your own database in Azure and use Power BI to make your data ‘ready for the road’</description>

      <title>Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS without Programming</title>
      <description>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at runtime without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at runtime. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</description>

      <title>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Stars…Alternative Date Warehouse Structures</title>
      <description>Beyond the Stars…Alternative Date Warehouse Structures to Empower Your Reporting and Analytics Team.
Star schema has become ubiquitous with Data warehouses and unless you have a well define cube modeled on top of it, they can be difficult for even experienced report writers to use. 
In this session, we will explore alternative structures that once built, with allow for rapid report development,  by anyone who can write a simple select statement; empowering your developers to provide business insight without the dubious task of ‘starting from scratch’.  
The following concepts and structures will be discussed:
•             Base/Detail Structures
•             Current State Structures
•             ‘Point In Time’ Data
•             Band Structures
•             Lifecycle/Timeline Structures
Additionally, we will discuss the importance of granularity, naming, object selection and refresh rates within the context of the aforementioned SQL structures.</description>
