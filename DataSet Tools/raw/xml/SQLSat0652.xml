      <title>Introducing the Limitless DBA-  Copy Data Management, DBA Style</title>
      <description>Everything in our day to day lives as a DBA is about limits-
•	Limits in space
•	Limits in platform
•	Limits in resources
•	Limits in expertise


This session is about how to remove those limits.  How to provide all the databases you need without having to constantly ask for more disk space.  How to provide a databases as fast as they are needed for new projects, new test cases and new challenges.  How to do more with less time, less people and less hardware and last but not least, how to do all of this without having to become an expert in 20 different languages, products and specialties. 

Join Kellyn Pot’Vin-Gorman as she demonstrates why virtualization is key to empowering the database administrator.  This session will cover how to:
•	Ease patching and upgrading.
•	Offer virtualized environments for every project-  development through production with only a 1/3 or the resources once required.
•	How to change OS and database platforms without losing your mind.</description>

      <title>Deep Dive into the SSIS Catalog</title>
      <description>The SSIS catalog is one of the best-evolved features in the SQL Server Integration Services ecosystem. With integrated package storage, Windows ACL-like security settings, built-in logging, and many other features, the SSIS catalog has become an anchor for many ETL architectures. With all this complexity, it is important to understand the inner workings of the SSIS catalog to keep it running smoothly.

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will dive into the details of the SSIS catalog. We will start with a quick survey of catalog features, followed by an exploration of the moving parts (tables, views, and stored procedures) in the catalog database. We will also review the security capabilities in the catalog, and will discuss maintenance operations. Finally, we'll walk through the mechanics of deployment and execution, reviewing what happens under the covers during these operations.</description>

      <title>Enabling EDW and BI workloads on Hadoop with Hive / LLAP</title>
      <description>In its origin, Hadoop was created as a distributed computing system designed to process data in batches, but the many advantages of the platform lead to an immediate desire to run interactive analytical queries against Data Lakes built on Hadoop.  So a few years back the Stinger initiative was created as an ongoing effort to bring interactive SQL querying capabilities to Hive, and its latest release has finally delivered! 
In this session, Luis Figueroa (Solutions Engineer @ Hortonworks) will walk you through the latest advancements that make Hadoop a powerful SQL engine that expands you EDW capabilities with unlimited scale and amazing flexibility. Luis will provide a technical overview of the Hive engine, an update on SQL compatibility with the ANSI standard,  real world use cases and a live demo. If you are a data pro this session is for you!</description>

      <title>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT and Prod is a challenge whither on premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Designing an SSIS Framework</title>
      <description>Enterprise data integration changed with the introduction of the SSIS Catalog. Implementing enterprise data integration often requires functionality beyond the rich features provided by the SSIS Catalog. Building on his previous work in the field of Data Integration Life Cycle Management (DILM) and SSIS Frameworks development, a Data Integration Architect with 10 years of SSIS experience explains the what, why, and how of an SSIS Catalog-integrated Framework that delivers metadata-driven package execution, connections management, and parameter configuration.

In this session, you will learn:
- A method for migrating packages from Development, through the data integration life cycle, to Production without editing SSIS Connection Manager Properties.
- A metadata-driven approach to SSIS package execution.
- A method for customizing enterprise data integration reporting.</description>

      <title>I like big data for $400  - Exploring quiz show questions using Angular, DocumentDB and Azure Search</title>
      <description>In this talk, we will explore two powerful technologies from the Microsoft Azure Stack: DocumentDB and Azure Search. DocumentDB is Microsoft's NoSQL service for building globally scalable schema-free applications. Azure Search allows you to integrate the power of Microsoft's search and natural language processing abilities to explore your complex data stores. During this talk we will cover the benefits of implementing a schema-free database, we will learn how to replicate your data at a global scale with the ease of a simple configuration and we will cover various techniques of querying that data using SQL and the DocumentDB API. Once we have a large datastore in place (we will use 200k+ Jeopardy questions), we will apply the powerful natural language querying capabilities and faceted search features of Azure Search to quickly create an searchable data repository. All of this will be built and exposed using a cross-platform application built in Angular on the Electron framework.</description>

      <description>Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. Women are penalized. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.</description>

      <title>Powering Azure from PowerShell</title>
      <description>Azure is seeing phenominal growth. More and more companies, from large enterprises to small start ups, are taking advantage of Azure to host their IT operations. As an IT Pro, you will be asked to manage all these services. While the Azure Portal is a nice user interface, we all know it simply won't scale in the face of the high demands placed on IT Pros. The solution is obvious: PowerShell! 

In this session you'll be introduced to the PowerShell cmdlets for managing your Azure infrastructure. You'll see how to manage your Azure storage, create virtual machines, and even work with SQL Azure. By the end of this session you'll understand how to use PowerShell to manage the most common Azure tasks.</description>

      <title>How to Move a Ton of Data from the Mainframe to the Cloud (with B</title>
      <description>So you need to move data from 75 tables on the mainframe to new tables in SQL Azure.  Do you: a) hand code one package to load all 75 tables, b) hand code 75 packages that move a table each, or c) wish there was a better way?
There is!  Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) can automate the creation of packages so that they all follow the same script.  In this beginner level session, we will create some simple metadata to be able to generate multiple packages and their associated connection managers.  You will see Biml in action.  You will see the XML that Biml uses to define packages and connections.  You will see the C# code that Biml uses to fetch metadata and dynamically generate packages in SSIS. And you will see packages and connection managers generated from Biml before your very eyes.</description>

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.</description>

      <description>"Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas."

Need a quick peek at your SQL Server database but don't want to wait for SSMS to start up? Need to run T-SQL queries from a 32-bit Windows 7 box? Working on a MacBook and don't want to switch to Windows just to run a quick SQL script? Time to try Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a free, open source code editor and IDE from Microsoft built on the Electron project which runs on most popular desktop and mobile systems and starts and executes FAST! Even better, it's extensible - using the MSSQL extension gives users access to stored connection strings, T-SQL for DDL and CRUD queries, and more. This session will demo install and use cases.</description>

      <description>A lot of my job involves leveraging knowledge that only I possess. Anecdotal stuff and volatile-state-of-the-data stuff that gets updated several times a day and is almost entirely in my own head. Taking vacations kind of sucks because that institutional knowledge travels with me, and no one is able to pick up my slack. All of my peers in the organization are in the same predicament.

Recently though, we've been capturing this institutional knowledge in small artificial intelligences. These systems act in an advisory capacity, routinely automating many of the research and state checks that we need to do our jobs.  These systems make us more productive, more collaborative, and enable some luxurious time away from the desk.

In this session, you'll learn how we identified the candidates for "micro-AIs," how easy these systems were to implement using freely available tools, and gain some of our hard-won insight into balancing automated AI and human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Performance Monitoring SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)</title>
      <description>SSAS Servers need maintenance and monitoring post deployment to production; however, when projects forgo this part the overall system performance can suffer. Just like every SQL Server requires a DBA to maintain it, every SSAS server needs a SSAS administrator. 
This session introduces you to SSAS administration beyond the initial development of a database. You will learn what to measure and how to determine acceptable ranges of those measurements for your environment. Demos will be used to show you how to use Task Manager, Perfmon and SQL Server Extended Events to get insights into a SSAS server’s health, identify the most common issues with a server in production, and make recommendations for changes to SSAS developers on your team.
If you have experience with SSAS development and are interested in learning about SSAS from the sever side, this session is for you. The focus of this session will be on SSAS multidimensional; however, many of the concepts apply to SSAS Tabular as well.</description>

      <title>Query Store – What is it all about?</title>
      <description>SQL 2016 brings us many new features but one of the most anticipated is surely the Query Store. The Query Store now allows us to track query plans as they change over time giving us a whole slew of new possibilities when it comes to tuning our queries. Even just the ability to compare a previous plan to a new plan is a huge step towards understanding what may be happening in our instance. We can even tell the optimizer which plan we want it to use. These were all either extremely difficult to do before and in some cases impossible to do. This session will give you the insight to get started using this new and wonderful feature set.</description>

      <description>Talk to any DBA about ORMs and you'll quickly find out all the things you like about ORMs are what DBAs don't like. Interestingly enough, most developers I've talked to have issues with their ORMs, too. In this session, we'll explore why ORMs cause such trouble, some strategies for mitigating those troubles, and I'll introduce some tools (and even yet another ORM) that help solve some of the worst of the problems we see in the database when using ORMs.</description>

      <title>T-SQL's Hidden Support Feature</title>
      <description>The most effective T-SQL support feature comes installed with every edition of SQL Server, is enabled by default, and costs no overhead. Yet, the vast majority of database administrator underutilize or completely neglect it. That feature's name is "comments".
 
In this session, Microsoft Certified Master Jennifer McCown will demonstrate the various commenting methods that make code supportable. Attendees will learn what’s important in a header comment, use code blocking to edit code, build a comprehensive help system, and explore alternative comment methods in stored procedures, SSIS packages, SSRS reports, and beyond.  These methods help prevent errors and reduce troubleshooting.</description>
