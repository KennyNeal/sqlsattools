Previously, he's been a Lead Software Developer, Architect, and DBA.  He started with SQL 2000 (unless you count DBase IV) and have written enterprise/layered applications since .NET became a thing.  His computer geek timeline starts during the Atari-Commodore wars - back when it was all the rage to have a 300 baud acoustical modem and develop in Atari Pascal.  He will be your friend if you've ever read on a screen, "It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue".

When he gets stuck on a problem he goes fishing.  He recommends outdoors as a therapy.</description>

      <title>Securing SQL Server Processes with Certificates</title>
      <description>What do you do if the DBA won’t let you enable the Trustworthy setting?
 
Things like Trustworthy and cross-database ownership chaining open up huge security threats. Fortunately, there’s a better way.
 
You can secure things like cross-database operations, service broker communication, and high-privileged stored procedure execution with certificates via a process call signing. Additionally things like CLR assemblies that need external access can be executed safely using signed assemblies instead of enabling Trustworthy.
 
This session will cover common processes that can be secured through certificate signing, show how to sign the processes, and cover some basics of certificate management.
 
Note: this session does not cover securing SQL Server connections with SSL or self-signed certificates.</description>

      <title>Where Does R Fit Into Your SQL Server Stack?</title>
      <description>Now that SQL Server 2016 includes support for R in the database, how does this change your BI implementation options?

In this session, we start with a brief introduction to R and explain why it’s increasingly popular, the typical development workflow, which tools you can use, common use cases, and where it fits into the latest Microsoft stack at a high level.

Then we’ll review how to implement R Services so that you can use R with SQL Server data, including how to install R packages on SQL Server, how to use rx functions, and how to operationalize R in SQL Server.

Then we explore options for using R to prepare data for analytics using SSIS or Power BI and how to report and visualize data using SSRS or Power BI.</description>

      <title>DBAs vs Developers: JSON in SQL Server 2016</title>
      <description>The war between DBAs and developers has been raging since the dawn of relational databases. One reason for disagreement comes from developers who want to store their data in JSON because it is fast, standard, and flexible. DBAs cringe when they hear of long text strings being stored in their SQL databases; they cry with concern, “No data validation? No schema binding?”. Is there any hope for these two warring factions to see eye-to-eye?

This session will explore the new JSON functionality introduced in SQL Server 2016. We will use T-SQL examples to learn how these functions can be used to parse, create, and modify JSON data. More importantly, we will discuss how to optimize performance when using these functions.

By the end of this session DBAs and developers will know how to efficiently work with JSON in SQL Server 2016. It will also usher in an era of peace between DBAs and developers…

… at least until someone brings up the topics of cursors, NOLOCKs, or Entity Framework.</description>

      <description>Most of the time pilots are learning to fly, they're actually learning how to recover from emergency conditions. While we as Database Administrators focus on taking backups, how much time do we actually spend practicing recovering with those backups? This session will focus on the kinds of situations that can dramatically affect a data center, and how to use checklists to practice recovery processes to assure business continuity.

Learning objectives:
1 Understand the kinds of issues that can arise in critical data environments
2 Understand the expectations for performance and recovery of those data environments
3 Define a Personal Minimums contract for meeting the data availability expectations of the business</description>

      <title>45 Minutes to Your First SSAS Tabular Model</title>
      <description>Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the new Azure Analysis Services product? Or you've looked at these and like what they can add in Power BI or classic BI scenarios, but haven't had a chance to dive in and figure all of this out? Now is the time!
SSAS Tabular is a new-ish form of business intelligence model released with SQL Server 2012, intended as an alternative to more traditional Multidimensional cubes. In this session, we will talk briefly about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various options for deployment, before exploring the development process of creating a tabular model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.</description>

      <title>Revenge: The SQL!</title>
      <description>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 

This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * and ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!

Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</description>

      <title>Are You There, DBA? It’s Me, The App Developer</title>
      <description>Are you a frustrated DBA trying to improve performance on an application you didn’t write? Or perhaps you’re an application developer struggling to understand why your queries run slowly on someone else’s database? This talk will cover practical techniques to help developers and DBAs work together efficiently to troubleshoot poorly performing applications. 

Beginner/Intermediate software developers and DBAs will learn: when you need the actual query execution plan (and how to get it), why queries executed from SSMS perform differently than they do in the application, and how you can improve an application to make database troubleshooting easier. When the DBA and Developer join forces, there’s no problem they can’t solve!</description>

      <title>Answering the question, "What happened?" with Query Store</title>
      <description>One of the most anticipated new features in SQL Server 2016 is Query Store. It's referred to as the "flight recorder" for SQL Server because it tracks query information, namely query plans and runtime statistics. If you've ever had to drop everything to troubleshoot a sudden change in performance, then you've probably already realized the value of this feature. 

In this session, we'll step through how Query Store works - you’ll understand what information it captures and how to access the historical data through the UI and the system views. We'll look at the data collected to identify queries that don't perform well and those that have regressions in performance due to different plans. Finally, we'll see how to force a specific plan for a query, discover what happens when the optimizer cannot use that plan, and examine how plan forcing compares to using plan guides. Expect to learn how to make troubleshooting easier with this feature that’s included in all editions of SQL Server 201</description>

      <title>Ethics, Morals, and Laws for the DBA 101</title>
      <description>Ethics, Morals, and Laws each aspects of our behavior as people and DBAs. They govern which actions we take and which actions we avoid.

Understanding the basics of these guides and how they coordinate (and sometimes conflict) with each other helps you to make choices you can live with from both a personal and professional perspective.

This session presents basic definitions, ideas, and discussion points. It is intended to be an interactive presentation where the audience contributes to the discussion, so no two presentations are exactly the same!</description>

      <title>Power BI and Azure ML - Better Together!</title>
      <description>There has been a lot of interest in the analytics community in visualizing the output of an Azure Machine Learning model inside Power BI. To add to the challenge, it would also be great to operationalize Azure ML models through the Power BI service. Imagine if you could have Power BI regularly bring in the latest output of your fraud model or the sentiment for recent Tweets about your products. This session will outline and demonstrate a proposed approach for doing just that.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Temporal Tables</title>
      <description>Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.</description>

      <description>Polybase is Microsoft's newest way of integrating SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  In this talk, we will get an overview of the Polybase technology and then implement it to work with an on-premises Hadoop cluster as well as Azure Blob Storage.  We will then dive into the mechanics of how Polybase works, using packet captures to understand the cross-network communication.  Finally, we will look at ways of tuning common Polybase scenarios and look at a few less-common scenarios.</description>

SQL Server Databaseology is the study of SQL Server databases and their structures down to the very core of the records themselves. In this session, we will explore some of the deep inner workings of a SQL Server database at the record and page level.  You will walk away with a better understanding of how SQL Server stores data and that knowledge will allow you to build better, faster databases.</description>

      <title>Why NULL is not a value (and other SQL gotchas)</title>
      <description>Allowing NULL "values" in your database is simple, but managing them is a whole different story. Learn what NULL really means and why you may want to avoid it in your systems. I will share techniques for overcoming NULL and other SQL idiosyncrasies leading to bad data or incorrect query results.</description>

      <title>Collecting Baseline Metrics</title>
      <description>How do you know when your server is on fire?  Without a set known-good measurements to compare against to look at you don’t.  This session will show you how to capture a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance. The session will help you decide what and when to capture data and where to store it. Then we will walk through different tools and scripts to use.  Then walk you through a scenario of using that data to identify a problem.</description>

      <title>The DBA's Role With N-tier Applications</title>
      <description>This session is for DBAs with little or no application architecture experience and/or application developers who want to work on enterprise applications.  We'll go over N-tier applications, what are the different tiers, and why DBAs should encourage enterprise application development in their company.  While the architecture is independent of any specific language, any examples will be in C#.  If done right, multiple languages can access the data in the same way and receive the same results.</description>

      <title>Data Visualization:  How to truly tell a great story!</title>
      <description>We have more information available to us today than ever before.  So much so that we run the risk of not being able to tell concise stories.  There's a lot more to creating that story than just getting the correct information.  Come learn not just the do's and don'ts, but the whys…</description>
