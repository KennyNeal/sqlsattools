      <title>SQL Injections and How to Stop Them</title>
      <description>Right now, there are hackers all around the world trying to get into your web applications. How safe are you? By using a technique called SQL injections, hackers can wreak havoc on web applications by compromising security, manipulating data, choking system resources, retrieving sensitive information, and modifying database objects. Without proper precautions, attackers can even drop databases! 

During the demo, we will take on a couple of different roles. As a hacker, we will walk through steps a hacker might take to compromise a web application in order to retrieve sensitive data such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. Assuming the role of a developer, we will then show various prevention techniques and their effectiveness in preventing SQL injections.

Attend this session to learn how SQL injections work, identify if you are being attacked, and how to stop them!</description>

      <title>A Masters Passport to Extended Events</title>
      <description>"As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This full day session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE.  Take advantage</description>

      <title>Bare Naked Skinny on SQL Server</title>
      <description>Ever feel like there are just too many layers with SQL Server? You peel off a layer and behold there is yet another layer. SQL Server is rather complex. The complexities can be rather frustrating from time to time. 

Join this NSFW (not safe for whining) session as we strip SQL down to the bare bones. I will help you undress the complexities of a few of the basic SQL Server concepts. These concepts will include locks, principals, query directives and deadlocks.

In this session I will disrobe misunderstandings related to the aforementioned topics. I will show the different types of principals in SQL Server. I will also show various scenarios involving locks and deadlocks along with some of their effects with and without query directives. The goal is to better understand these topics and to hopefully stop using and perpetuating common mis-uses of terminology and common misconceptions about the technology.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Troubleshooting Checklist for SQL Server</title>
      <description>Learning how to detect, diagnose and resolve performance problems in SQL Server is tough.  Often, years are spent learning how to use the tools and techniques that help you detect when a problem is occurring, diagnose the root-cause of the problem, and then resolve the problem.  

In this session, attendees will see demonstrations of the tools and techniques which make difficult troubleshooting scenarios much faster and easier, including:

• XEvents, Profiler/Traces, and PerfMon 
• Using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
• Advanced Diagnostics Using Wait Stats
• Reading SQL Server execution plan 

Every DBA needs to know how to keep their SQL Server in tip-top condition, and you’ll need skills the covered in this session to do it.</description>

      <title>SQL server on containers – Part 2</title>
      <description>Please attend Part 1 before to get full usage of this session 

Those of you remember physical server consolidation phase started with VM, and struggle to run SQL server on VM with predictable performance…. Since than this is biggest change in the way SQL will be installed. Windows 16 introduced containers support, headless NANO servers and SQL server 2017 with complete support for creating containers using Dockers, a defacto industry standard API for container packaging is to allow running SQL Server as micro-services. No matter you want to deploy SQL server on Linux or windows containers are the way…
 
Will show you how can you install 5 SQL server implementations in 5 minute with each dedicated SQL implementation taking 15 GB of space. Will show you how containerization solves the “dependency hell” problem by incorporating software dependencies into a container image and provide smooth application deployment…

      <title>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</title>
      <description>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</description>

      <description>In one small step, SQL Server 2016 has taken a giant leap...to JSON! In this session, we'll launch a probe into a JSON data file containing profiles of NASA astronauts using new JSON T-SQL functions in SQL Server. With each astronaut we meet, we'll learn to validate, read, and manipulate "unstructured" JSON data. We'll get The Right Stuff to start developing, no previous JSON experience required. Let's go where NoSQL has gone before!

Prerequisites:
You should have experience writing queries in T-SQL. No previous knowledge of JSON is needed.</description>

      <title>SQL Server 2016 and R Service introduction</title>
      <description>Introduction of R in SQL Server R service
One of the biggest changes in SQL Server 2016 on the analytics front is the inclusion of R into the database engine.  SQL Server R Services is the result of Microsoft’s acquisition of Revolution Analytics. R is a popular open-source data analysis language that’s used by data scientists, statisticians and data analysts for data analysis, data exploration and predictive modeling. R can produce both data analytic results and data visualizations. However, in the past, the use of R in an enterprise environment involved several challenges. By marrying R with its core data platform, Microsoft is signaling that it is serious about advancing its analytic offerings not only in the cloud, but on-premise as well. This presentation will tell why it’s important for SQL developer to know R and vice versa.</description>

      <title>SQL server on containers – Part 1</title>
      <description>Windows 16 introduced containers which has started a new era which will help with VM consolidation big time, the future of SQL Implementations is about installing SQL Server on Windows 16 NANO Server running as containers. It provides an isolated, resource controlled, predictable and portable operating environment inside a VM.

SQL server 2017 with complete support for creating containers using Dockers, a defacto industry standard API for container packaging is to allow running SQL Server as micro-services. Docker has industry-wide support with hosted services on Azure/AWS, monitoring, logging, orchestration. No matter you want to deploy SQL server on Linux or windows containers are the way…

This introductory session will help seasoned SQL Server DBA/Developers understand the basics of containers and windows 16 NANO servers running SQL Server 2016  17. in subsequent session Prakash will cover several demos and share scripts to start with containers</description>

      <title>Changing Your Habits to Improve the Performance of Your T-SQL</title>
      <description>Do you dread handing your T-SQL over for code review? Do your queries run slower than you expect? Does the DBA always want to tweak your T-SQL? In this demo-heavy session, we’ll take a look at various ways to improve your T-SQL. You’ll learn why top down design is not always the best pattern as well as why implicit conversions can slow down your queries. You’ll learn how to rewrite most cursors as well as finding out how user defined functions affect performance. You’ll learn some simple ways to troubleshoot these types of issues using execution plans and extended events. Finally, we’ll take a look at how standards can help quicken turnaround time when refactoring T-SQL. By changing some of your T-SQL writing habits you can improve performance of queries from the very beginning.</description>

      <title>Managing Your Schema with Database Projects in Visual Studio</title>
      <description>Integrating databases schema changes into a Software Development Lifecycle Management (SDLC) process can be a  daunting and often tedious proposition. Adding  the complexity of version control to the mix complicates this scenario. Fortunately, beginning with Visual Studio 2012, Database Projects add an "easy" button to this process. In this session, you will learn about the features and capabilities of VS Database Projects and how to use them to improve the lifecycle of your database structures, even if your organization does no code management.</description>

      <title>Concurrency in SQL Server - a.k.a. What to do when your database has more than 1 user</title>
      <description>Have you ever worked on a database used by more than one person?  ;-)  If so, then this session is for you!  In this session we'll talk about what happens when multiple processes compete for the same resources  (aka "Concurrency").  We'll break down SQL Server's isolation levels, and the trade-offs between concurrency and such scary-sounding things as "dirty",  "phantom" reads. There will be practical demo's and some real-life examples "from the trenches".   There are a lot of misconceptions out there about this topic, you may be surprised!</description>

      <title>DBA 101 – Let’s Get It Started</title>
      <description>We've all installed SQL Server and, most of the times, the default settings work just fine.  This is a beginner session that will help you to understand what those settings mean along with why there might be times that you want to use something other than the defaults and how that might impact your server.  We'll also go through unattended installs, both with and without a config file.  This can really help to standardize your SQL Server installations and save you some precious keystrokes.</description>

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

      <title>But it worked great in Dev!  Perfomance for Devs</title>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you.  For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge.  But too  often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL.  In this session, we  will examine why "SQL that works" is not good enough.  Understanding  indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing  good T-SQL.  We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that  "worked great in dev" but caused major issues when it hit production.</description>

      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>Fun with SQL Server Spatial Data</title>
      <description>This session is an introduction to the spatial features in SQL Server. In this session, you will learn how to create, procure and leverage spatial data.  You will be made aware of tools you can use to integrate your own spatial data with a variety of public data sources such as the Census Bureau, National Weather Service, etc. Functions and T-SQL commands related to spatial data analysis will be demonstrated. We will end the session by using the geometry data type to actually mimic a bitmapped picture using SQL (that's the fun part!).</description>

      <title>Weird stuff I saw ... while supporting a Java team</title>
      <description>After spending more than a decade completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I did some time supporting a Java team. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. But it is a different stack, different culture, and different group of folks giving bad advice to developers ... just enough different to keep life interesting. Come hear about my misadventures with server side cursors, output parameters, integrated authentication, and NOCOUNT settings.</description>

      <title>Tuning SQL Server Transactional Replication</title>
      <description>If you worked with transactional replication at some point in your career, then you had to answer the dreaded question why is the data so old in the subscriber? Unable to find the culprit, you just re-synch the data, hate replication, and move on. Wonder what you could do differently? In this session, you will learn the moving parts, the bottlenecks, the tuning knobs, and perhaps to love replication.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Containers and Clones</title>
      <description>“Containers and Clones for SQL Server Development and Test”
 
Microsoft is emphasizing the use of containers for development and test on SQL Server 2017, and new solutions from Red Gate and Windocks add support for containers and SQL Server database database cloning,  for the full range of the SQL Server family.   We’ll explore use of Docker based tooling for delivery of container environments, and their pros and cons.     We’ll also look at SQL Server cloning, and how clones enable Dev and Test teams to work on large database environments for containers as well as existing SQL Server instances.</description>

      <title>The Ins and Outs of SQL Indexes</title>
      <description>This course will focus on the fundamentals of strategic SQL Server index design and creation. Terms that will be covered and clarified: clustered index, non-clustered index, uniqueness, covering index, fill-factor, scan, seek, key lookup, and fragmentation. This is a beginning level course for those who have always found indexes confusing and somewhat elusive.  Lots of valuable information will be provided in a short amount of time.</description>
