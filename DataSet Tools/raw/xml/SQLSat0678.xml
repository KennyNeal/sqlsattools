      <title>Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans!</title>
      <description>Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.</description>

      <title>Creating Reports and Dashboards with Power BI</title>
      <description>This session looks at both Power BI Desktop and Power BI.com to compare the advantages and capabilities of both platforms for creating and distributing data analysis within your organization.  It will also touch a little on why you might choose Power BI over Power Pivot and why you might not.  It will also look at how to create drill down detail screens to expose the details behind your visualizations.  Finally, we will touch on how to publish your Power BI results for others in your organization to share.  A basic understanding of database structures and referential integrity is an advantage to gain the most from this session, but as will be shown, not always necessary depending on the source of the data to be analyzed.</description>

      <title>What’s new for SQL Server Analysis Services?</title>
      <description>So, do we stick with the Cube or move to Tabular? Has DAX functionality improved enough to rely on performance with DirectQuery in a Tabular Model? Will we be porting Analysis Service (SSAS) databases to Azure? How do we know what level or pricing model is adequate for an Azure SSAS database?
When an SSAS database gets created, and users start to report against, it is very hard not to continue to expand the model. Anxiety is released when a new release of SSAS comes along adding functionality to replace the hooks created to satisfy user requirements. With 2016 and 2017, Microsoft is moving to update Tabular Models with more features, improved performance and better security. The Cube additions are mainly with Data Sources and better T-SQL generated to access source databases like Oracle and Teradata.
So, let us examine the pros and cons together and get a consensus of the path forward with SSAS. You are definitely not going to want to stop using this tool.</description>

      <title>Monitoring and Alerting of Availability Groups</title>
      <description>So you have your availability groups configured and everything reports green.  How do you measure SLA compliance? Do you know when replication is delayed? Were you notified when it failed over last night?
This session will answer all these questions and more, and will show you what you should be looking at to ensure no surprises.
We will look at the DMVs, extended event sessions, perfmon counters, SQL agent jobs and alerts to show what to monitor in your AG and how to setup alerting so you know when to take action.
Demo:  Show AG dashboard and cause AG failures and excessive delay and show how alerts are sent
Goals:  
Teach what to monitor in AGs for proper health
Alert on events when they occur which the DBA should know about
Demonstrate alerts and notifications when failures or delays occur in your environment</description>

      <title>Uptight Database Security</title>
      <description>Do you work for an institution that fears it’s DBAs could go rogue on their production databases? 
Do you want to revoke continuous sysadmin permissions from your DBA team in an attempt to avoid being the next WikiLeak? 
Do you have concerns that the DBA team is querying sensitive databases?
Then, you need Uptight Database Security. 
Come to this session to learn how to deploy a configurable permission model that provides on-demand access to SQL Server databases. This model allows DBAs to do routine work without sysadmin, elevate permissions to sysadmin only during production emergencies or disaster recovery scenarios. Attendees  will leave this session with the fundamental knowledge and scripts to implement a low hassle solution that provides DBAs the minimum necessary access required to maintain a production database server.</description>

      <title>Cautionary Tale of Recompilations, Excessive CPU Load and Plan Caching</title>
      <description>SQL Server reduces compilation and optimization overhead by caching and reusing execution plans for the queries. Plan caching helps to reduce CPU load on the server; however, it may also introduce unexpected issues and lead to suboptimal execution plans and performance problems.  

In this session, Dmitri will explain how plan caching works internally and demonstrate how to address several common issues related to the plan caching. He will talk about parameter sniffing, simple and forced parameterization, OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN strategy, and several other related topics.    Finally, Dmitri will provide the guidelines how to reduce CPU load and recompilation overhead in the systems with heavy ad-hoc workload and non-parameterized queries.</description>

      <title>vNUMA, pNUMA, save your SQL Servers from certain DoomA</title>
      <description>When presented with large SQL Server workloads in a virtual environment, which cross NUMA boundaries, it is very important to understand how the hypervisor presents vNUMA to the SQL Server virtual machine.  When there is a NUMA imbalance, it can have as much as a 40% impact on performance, causing a significant effect on your virtual environment.  In this session attendees will learn ways to optimize vNUMA including:
•	How vNUMA works across different processors; and the ways that Intel and AMD are different
•	Methods for determining if a NUMA imbalance exists
•	Which settings at the hypervisor, or virtual machine level, should be changed to ensure the best performance</description>

      <title>A DBA's guide to whole stack performance troubleshooting</title>
      <description>Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.</description>

We will discuss a brief overview of the syntax, how to write an In-Database R query, and then dive into a data set using the Lahman database  data from Retrosheets.org to examine baseball games from 1990 – 2016 to answer the following questions: If I want to see my team win a game should I go to a double header?  What is the best day of the week to see my team play?  What is the best day if they are above .500 or below?  What if they have home vs. away games?  Then we will display the results in Power BI or and Excel Dashboard. Come for the Science stay for the data!</description>

      <title>Getting graphy with CosmosDB Graph API with Gremlin</title>
      <description>CosmosDB was announced at Build 2017 as an extension to Microsoft's DocumentDB offering and is positioned to be a key component of the Microsoft Data Platform. In this session, we will explore CosmosDB's graph API that is built using Apache's TinkerPop and Gremlin projects. Graph databases allow you to build a powerful data model that explores connections and paths between data. At the end of this session, attendees will have a solid understanding of what a graph database is and how you can use Gremlin and the .NET API to interact with a graph database.</description>
