      <description>Greg Moore is a graduate of RPI. There, he majored in CompSci, but probably spent as much time hiking, canoeing, caving and rock-climbing as he did studying.
He started working with SQL Server 4.21a in 1995 and has survived numerous upgrades.
He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.</description>

He started working with SQL Server 4.21a in 1995 and has survived numerous upgrades.
He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.</description>

      <title>SQL Server R Services in SQL 2016</title>
      <description>One of the most exciting new features of SQL Server 2016 is the integration of the R statistical programming language into the platform with the brand-new SQL Server R Services.  In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.

      <title>Introduction to Unit-Testing in SQL Server</title>
      <description>It’s bad enough to spend hours finding and fixing database defects, explaining to the rest of the team what went wrong and trying to clean up the mess. It’s even worse when a defect causes the end-user to make a bad decision. Database defects are far too costly and most testing practices do not adequately detect or prevent them.

In this session you’ll learn techniques to write SQL code that is resilient to defects and is easier to change and maintain. We will cover writing simple unit tests and look into more advanced topics such as faking tables and spying procedures. We will also look at how unit testing improves code quality and maintainability.

You will leave this session ready to write unit tests for your own environment to get started on the way to a defect-free and maintainable SQL Server code base.</description>

      <title>Version control with GIT for the DBA</title>
      <description>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. In that same note, github, the most popular service for hosting git repositories has become so ubiquitous that Microsoft chose to host the source code for its OSS fork of the .NET framework there instead of its own codeplex.

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
How do I fork a SVN repo to github?

We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.</description>

      <title>Reading Between the Lines - Using XEvents to Diagnose Application Issues</title>
      <description>In this Session, 3 different approaches to using Extended Events will be covered - culminating in a non-traditional approach of using them to determine what is MISSING -- thus the application / network portion of a user experience.

We will cover using XEvents  to do the following:
1. The Long Running Query. 
2. The Thousand Paper Cuts - De-Parameterization  Aggregation 
3. Looking at Space Between SQL Calls (how to determine when application slowness does NOT involve the SQL Server). 
 
Each approach will detail the following:
 
Creating an Extended Events Session to capture the information you need for each scenario.
How to analyze and make sense of the captured data. 
Lots of demos and take-away scripts!</description>

      <title>Securing the Data Platform: Crafting a Strategy That Works (Paid Pre-con)</title>
      <description>Your database servers are insecure, and you know it. Unfortunately, so does the person upstairs who just wants to take a peek. That executive who wants a copy of the database to build some reports on the plane knows it. So does the call center rep who’s trying to provide great service to the customer on the phone. And the hacker who’s attacking your website? Yeah, they know it, too. We can no longer rely solely on the same old security practices to protect our data. We need to secure the data at its source. 

In this full-day course, we will take a tour of security for the Microsoft data platform, particularly SQL Server. The complex security needs of SQL Server itself will be presented as a series of layers to give participants a framework for planning and implementation. By the end of the day, participants will gain familiarity with tools and techniques they can use to protect their systems from common threats.</description>

      <title>A Masters Passport to Extended Events</title>
      <description>"As is commonly the case, all good things come to an end.  And now is as good a time as any for the use of SQL Trace and Profiler to come to an end.  Let’s face it, Trace was a good tool and had some wonderful uses.  Profiler for that matter was a good tool and was useful at times.
It is time to let those old tools retire gracefully and move into the world of XE.  This full day workshop will provide you the means to let Profiler and Trace be retired from your toolset as you discover all that XE has to offer.

This full day session on Extended Events will help prepare you to put this tool to immediate use as you walk back to your daily duties.  This workshop will teach you about Extended Events starting with the basics and moving through how to create XE sessions that will get the right data for you, while doing so with minimal impact.

You will be exposed to advanced troubleshooting techniques as we work through complex issues that are made easier through the use of XE.  Take advantage</description>

      <title>Dammit Jim! Dr McCoy’s Field Guide to system_health (and the default trace)</title>
      <description>As DBAs, we are asked all sorts of impossible questions.  Who dropped that important table last month?  Why was everything slow last week?  Who made that user a sysadmin?  You’d have to be a mind reader to know the answers to some of those, right?  Not necessarily!  SQL Server can help you find information about these and other common problems with its default trace and system_health Extended Events session, but you have to know how to collect and interpret the data they provide.  In this session, we’ll explore what system_health and the default trace are, what information they contain, and how to use them to find the answers you’re searching for.</description>

      <title>Network your Way to Success!</title>
      <description>Did you know that most employers  -- whether looking for a full time employee, contractor, or consultant – interview people because of their technical skills and experiences, but hire and keep them for their social capital?  In times of economic downturn, it’s not the person who is the most competent who stays; it’s the one who’s most competent, likeable, and connected.   Socially adept people also get invited to the table more often for big projects and are promoted (or extended) more frequently than purely ‘competent’ individuals. 

Whether or not you’ve been in your role for a few months, years, or even decades – or you’re looking for a new job and new opportunities -- strategic networking is the way to make yourself more relevant, more attractive for projects and promotion – or more hirable by potential customers.  

Join us for an interactive session to strategize the best actions to increase your social capital and network your way to success!</description>

      <title>Azure SQL Databases: A Guided Tour</title>
      <description>You know about the cloud but you’re not there yet. Is it hard? Is it easy? How do you get started? Come to this session and see for yourself. We’ll start with nothing and end up with a deployed Azure SQL Database. We’ll even run a quick PowerBI report and enable Geo-Redundant Disaster Recovery with a few clicks.

The goal is to take the mystery out, to show the capabilities and get you thinking about what going to the cloud could look like and what it can do for you and your company. I believe the future belongs to those who have this knowledge and know where to apply it.

This will be nearly PowerPoint free and we’ll log into my Azure Portal and build out an environment from scratch and learn as we go. We’ll migrate data from an “on-premises” database into our SQL DB and we’ll query it. You’ll leave with an understanding of the capabilities, some resource links outlining what we did and hopefully some curiosity to see what else is up there in the cloud as you start exploring.</description>

      <title>Let Her Finish: Supporting Women's Voices in Technology</title>
      <description>Next time you attend a meeting, watch what happens when women at the table offer ideas. If your office is like most in America, you’ll notice women are interrupted almost three times as often as men. Some interruptions are to assert dominance but sometimes people do it to be helpful  offer affirmation. Regardless of the intent, the results are the same. Women are being left out of the conversation. The consequences are real. Male executives that speak more frequently in meetings are rewarded with 10% higher competence ratings from peers  better performance reviews from bosses. This translates into $ when raises and bonuses are handed out.
 This discussion will cover positive solutions that help women’s voices be heard. Women need to be more assertive. We need to learn to say “Stop interrupting me.” and “I just said that.” However, men can be, no HAVE to be, part of the solution. They can help women become part of the conversation.</description>

      <description>Based on the award-winning interview television show Inside the Actors Studio, this session is an interview with a “SQLebrity” from the community. Interview subjects will share their path to success, discussing both their successes and their failures along the way. 
Host Andy Mallon persuades his interviewee (Rie Irish) to discuss personal experiences during his chats while discussing the highlights and lowlights of her career.

We will talk about Rie's childhood, how she got started in the business, her early career, and behind-the-scenes trivia. The interview concludes with the Proust Questionnaire, made famous by Bernard Pivot (Apostrophes) and James Lipton (Inside the Actors Studio). Attendees will also have an opportunity to ask their own questions.</description>

      <title>Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know</title>
      <description>Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Workloads with SQL Server Resource Governor</title>
      <description>With heavily consolidated instances and competing workloads, the Enterprise only Resource Governor feature is an incredibly useful tool for any DBA to have in their toolbox. It allows for the effective throttling and control of CPU, memory and I/O consumed by multiple workloads running on a single SQL Server instance. In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of the SQL Server Resource Governor and provide demonstrations of practical scenarios where Resource Governor can control resources for specific workloads. Some of these demonstrations include how to limit the amount of memory consumed by memory-optimized tables and how to prevent poorly-written queries from overwhelming your storage subsystem. We will also discuss cases where Resource Governor can mitigate parameter sniffing problems. Finally, we will look at ways to leverage the useful information contained in the Resource Governor DMVs for monitoring and reporting.</description>

In this session we will break down locking types, capturing and identifying deadlocks and the code behind them, and things you can do to resolve and prevent blocking and deadlocks. If you are frequently dealing with deadlocks in your databases this session is for you.</description>

      <title>SQL Server - R Services</title>
      <description>SQL Server R Services: Microsoft acquired Revolution Analytics in early 2015, and introduced R services (in-database/stand-alone) with SQL Server 2016.  With the first Microsoft Data Science summit behind us last Sept, in Atlanta, let us review what R Services in SQL Server brings to the table and see how it complements/supersedes features that are available with other R offerings (R GUI, Microsoft R Client [R Studio], Microsoft R Open [RROpen], Microsoft R Server[RREnterprise] etc.,)</description>

      <title>New Instance, Now what?</title>
      <description>Congratulations, you’re now our DBA!   A new SQL instance is like a blank canvas, you stare at it and wonder where to start.  As an accidental dba, this session will help you learn how to survive in your new role.

In this session, you will be supplied with the beginning brush strokes to make your server a master piece. To do so, we will review best practices for standard configurations, backups, maintenance, and disaster recovery. 

By the end of this session, you will have developed a pallet of tools to help you create your SQL Server Masterpiece and be able to use it as a print for others.</description>

      <title>SQL Graph</title>
      <description>Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has been adding a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017, and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft products).  Microsoft recently added Graph DB to their DocumentDB (product) and released it as Cosmos DB.  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.</description>

      <title>Extended Events - Better than Profiler</title>
      <description>Extended Events were introduced in SQL Server 2008. With SQL 2014, we have seen a significant upgrade to this feature. Join me for a little adventure into the realm of extended events. We will discuss how to use extended events to aid in performance tuning and in day to day administration. We will also explore some background and the architecture of extended events. This is a fast paced session and will be a lot of fun. Attendees will be able to take back several sample XE sessions to help troubleshoot different issues and get to more intimately know their data/environment.</description>

      <title>Data Cleansing With SQL And R</title>
      <description>On a given project, data scientists can spend upwards of 80% of their time preparing, cleaning, and correcting data. In this session, we will look at different data cleansing and preparation techniques using both SQL Server and R. We will investigate the concept of tidy data and see how we can use tools in both languages to simplify research and analysis of a small but realistic data set.</description>

      <title>Why is my DBA So Grumpy ... When I Use NOLOCK and Other Query Hints.</title>
      <description>Most of us have heard that using the NOLOCK hint is not recommended. But why is this? What is it about NOLOCK that sends most DBAs into a tizzy? And how about other hints such as ROWLOCK and RECOMPILE - are they OK to use? Come hear a discussion on why exactly query hints cause problems when used excessively, and watch some demos of NOLOCK craziness in action.</description>

      <title>Getting the Most Out of Plan Reuse</title>
      <description>Both DBA’s and Developers should be acutely aware of what it takes to ensure that every call to SQL Server has the best chance of reusing a previously generated query plan. Having to generate a new plan each time will waste precious resources and ultimately prevent you from obtaining peak performance and scalability for that SQL Server Instance. We will cover the fundamentals of how query plans get reused and how you need to write your code to take advantage of that. Lots of demos will show just how critical some of your code choices can be in order to obtain peak performance.</description>

      <title>Architecting a Data Lake (Paid Pre-con)</title>
      <description>This full-day session on Friday, Dec. 8, 2017 will focus on principles for designing and implementing a data lake. There will be a mix of concepts, lessons learned, and technical implementation details. This session is approximately 70% demonstrations: we will create a data lake, populate it, organize it, query it, and integrate it with a relational database via logical constructs. You will leave this session with an understanding of the benefits and challenges of a multi-platform analytics/DW/BI environment, as well as recommendations for how to get started.</description>

      <description>So you've decided to take the leap into presenting. Maybe it's at your local user group, maybe it's at SQL Saturday.
This talk will guide you through the process of selecting a topic, preparing for it and actually giving it.

We'll talk about what can go wrong and how to handle that.
We'll also talk about what can be done to prevent something from going wrong in the first place.

What are some good guidelines to follow and when can, or even should, you break them.

This will be partly interactive so come with questions and be prepared to be asked some.</description>

      <description>Are you a SQL developer, or a DBA responsible for squeezing every last drop of performance out of your instances? If so, few things are more important than a solid understanding of SQL Server indexes. In this session you will learn the basics of index internals and design, and then use that understanding to explore some common indexing anti-patterns. This session starts from the ground up, so it is suitable for anyone wanting to learn more about indexes.</description>

      <description>For the last 25 years SQL Server DBAs administered SQL databases using only Windows GUI.
For majority of them even Windows Core is too hard to accept.
In the situation, when Microsoft invaded Linux territory with it's flagship product, as SQL DBA, you must not outsource SQL Server administration to some Linux geeks. 
You can do it yourself!
Your way!
And I show you how to do it.</description>

      <description>Why do some planes with very few issues crash while a plane with no engine power can land safely on the Hudson with no loss of life?

Every company will eventually have a disaster. It's just a matter of size and scope. This talk is a general overview of how to respond to an incident and talks about the roles of management and IT. 

This is not your typical discussion of disasters focusing on how to make a backup plan or enable high availability.

I'll touch upon what we can learn from plane crashes and how those lessons can be applied to the IT environment in general.</description>
