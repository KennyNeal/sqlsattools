      <title>Azure Data Lake Analytics: Leveraging the Modern Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>What you feared has come upon you: You’ve been happily building business intelligence solutions the traditional way for years; Finally, the big data curse has caught up with you. Your organization wants to exploit their big data along with their day-to-day transactional data. You are now tasked with storing all this in one place and working your analytics magic on it. You start wondering how and where you would store this data, what kind of hardware you would need and and how you would learn everything from storing to processing to analysis in a short time – after all big data is a different type of beast from transactional data.
Fear not, all you need to do is look to the heavens; with Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Lake Analytics, you could get started quite fast. After an introduction to Azure Data Lake, we will dive into how you could perform simple yet power analytics using methods that are familiar with Azure Data Lake Analytics.</description>

      <title>SQL Consolidation with Azure SQL Database: an IT Pro  DBA's view.</title>
      <description>Azure SQL Database has come a long way, and for MS SQL, it's ahead of its other public Cloud competitors by miles. This session will look at the practical benefits of using a fully managed SQL Server database as a platform for traditional DBA-managed SQL consolidation. We'll take a look at the benefits in terms of technology and cost models, as well as a direct comparison with SQL Server on-premise and comparisons with other public Cloud providers. We'll also take a look at the most significant features that have been added in the last year that'll make you change your mind about adopting this as your next Database.</description>

      <description>Azure Cosmos DB is an evolution of Azure Document DB. 
It's the industry first globally distributed database service, allow you to scale storage and throughput across many geographical regions with promising low latency.
Cosmos DB supports for multi model database, different types of database engines like key-value, document, graph and multi API support like SQL, Azure Table Storage, Gremlin, MongoDB.
Let's see in action with a demo, how you can transfer your complex data into a simpler format with Document API and scale it in different regions with specific storage and throughput.</description>

      <title>Cloud Data Warehousing: Azure SQL Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>The heart of almost all Business Intelligence solutions; Relational Data Warehouse, has been servicing us for decades making the implementation is complete and success. It was always an On-Premises database, but now it is available as a Database-as-a-Service with Microsoft Azure, called Azure SQL Data Warehouse. It is a MPP cloud-based, scale-out relational database that supports workloads from few hundred gigabytes to petabytes of data and it addresses all modern requirements in data warehousing. Let’s talk about traditional On-Premises data warehouse little bit and then discuss about Azure SQL Data Warehouse and implementation of it.</description>

      <title>DBATools! The reason to finally start learning and using Powershell</title>
      <description>Powershell has been part of Windows for &gt; 10 years and has been part of SQL Server since 2008.
In spite of this the adoption among Database Professionals for use in investigating and managing their environments has been low.

With the release of the open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO, with its 300+ commands, the time has arrived for Database Professionals to embrace PowerShell and upgrade their skills to support the modern Hybrid environment.

In this session we will look how to download, install and begin using the power within both this module and Powershell.

No prior experience with Powershell required!</description>
