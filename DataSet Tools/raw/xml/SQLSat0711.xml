      <title>The Maths behind Machine Learning</title>
      <description>The new world of Machine Learning can sound quite overwhelming! Do I need a PhD in Machine Learning to get involved? The answer, thankfully, is no. But what you do need, which is often neglected, is a solid understanding of the theory behind the models.

This session will look to do just that, looking at some of the most popular algorithms used today, we will explore the maths involved, to help us understand our problems and get the best results possible. We will be also diving into practical examples, using Databricks to consume a dataset and to visualise results, with R scripts to execute the Machine Learning models.

If you would like an introduction to the world of Machine Learning and to acquire a solid grounding that will help you develop the skill, then this is the session for you.</description>

      <title>Bringing DevOps to your database</title>
      <description>Application code deployment is an easy thing as long as it is stateless. But what about the databases which are intrinsically stateful?
Have you ever deployed a new release of your database schema manually? How sure were you that you followed 100% of the steps from you deployment list. Do you feel nervous when the time for a new release comes by?
I will show you how to introduce the DevOps principles to your databases in order to be much effective in your business and significantly reduce the lead time.
The technologies we are going to have in our tool belts are SQL Server Database Tools, Azure Resource Manager and Release Management in VSTS(Visual Studio Team Services). For the advanced scenarios, we will take a look at Build  Deployment Contributors.</description>

      <title>RC, SI, and RCSI -It's So Confusing. Which Should You Use?</title>
      <description>I'm just going to say it straight out. I'm pessimistically optimistic that most really understand transaction concurrency in SQL Server. There is often significant confusion about transaction concurrency and contention options available to Developers -is it 'pessimistic', or 'optimistic', or in between? Everyone ‘sort of’ understands READ COMMITTED (RC). But do you sometimes feel 'dirty' as you attempt to 'repeatedly' read that phantasma? In order to reduce locking and blocking conflicts, some folks adopt SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (SI). And a few hardy stalwarts have ventured into the new world of READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION (RCSI). In this session, we will explore the differences between the three, including a discussion about the positives and negatives of each option. We will discuss the effects of 'Dirty', 'Repeatable' and 'Phantom' reads, and why you may want to know which may be buried in your code. There will be code examples demonstrating the benefits and traps of each option.</description>

      <title>Get data insights faster with Data Wrangling</title>
      <description>Self-Service Data Preparation aka Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. Traditional approach doesn't work here, data analysts and data scientists have to wait until IT guys gather requirements and prepare a right dataset for them. Time from raw data to insights is too long. In this session, I invite you together look closer at Self-Service Data Prep and show how it would help to get insights and make decisions faster, onboard new data sources without IT, and increase efficiency for data analysts and data scientists.</description>

      <title>How do SQL DB projects support DB scheme and help you make weekly or daily releases?</title>
      <description>I will present a perspective how you can easily support and update DB scheme by SQL Server Db Project, how it helps to make fast and quick releases. What is the right branch strategy, automatization and continuous integration. You can see how SQL server DB Project helps you prepare update script, easy comparison between PRO and Dev Db scheme without direct access to PRO. How each Developer will own Dev Db for 2 – 3 seconds. How you can make fast and safety refactoring of the name of column, table, view, sp and so on. What is the right way to structure DB Project? How we can make an easy code review of DB change by Developers?

      <title>The hidden power of Power BI or what we can do using Power BI REST API</title>
      <description>Power BI is a very powerful tool. But behind the shiny UI, Power BI REST API gives you even more features to create better solutions! In this session we will make one simple report from scratch and then we will explore what you can do using Power BI REST API and what you can’t (at least not yet!). I will demonstrate how your program can authenticate itself (both in interactive and non-interactive way), how it can add new rows to a dataset or refresh it programmatically, and how to share one dataset between multiple reports. By the end of this session we will get a complete reporting solution, with a monthly cost as a decent pizza! :)</description>

      <title>Chatbots for Dummies</title>
      <description>The software development landscape is changing. More and more, there is an increased demand for AI and cloud solutions.  As a user buying cinema tickets online, I would like to simply ask "I want to buy two cinema tickets for the movie Dunkirk, tomorrow's viewing at 1pm" instead of manually following a pre-defined process. 

In this session, we will learn how to build, debug and deploy a chatbot using the Azure Bot Service. We will enrich it using the Microsoft Cognitive suite to achieve human like interactions. 

Will it pass the Turing test, no, but we can extend the bot service using Machine Learning (LUIS), APIs (Web Apps) and Worflows (Logic Apps).</description>

      <description>We will cover the main aspects to migrate to one of the three architectures available in SQL Server in Azure from SQL Server On Premise. 

This session consists of:
-&gt; What is the best platform for my environment? IaaS, PaaS, or SQL Datawarehouse.
-&gt; Best Practices and best tools for our migration process depending on the platform chosen.
-&gt; After the migration, we have several outstanding questions:
            Can I keep both environments synchronized?
             How is the performance of my database?</description>

      <title>Query tuning when indexes cannot help</title>
      <description>Creating an index seems to be a silver bullet for optimizing a performance of a query. If this is true, then most of performance problems seems to go away, but they exist. And there are lots of cases when creating yet another index doesn't help. When do indexes help and when do you need to just take a different approach - rewriting the query for removing bad patterns. In this session I will show you how to decide to create an index or not, and which query patterns don't benefit from indexes. You will see some reason of the plan warnings, cardinality errors, and how to avoid them.</description>

In this presentation we will explore Azure IoT places where queries are used and see how to use them. And in the process to find out more about this “SQL-like” languages and how being a DB developer cam make you a IoT hero.
We will concentrate on the scenarios with the greatest impact, where a little SQL can solve you a lot of hassle.
So, we will leave no SQL query unturned  in Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, Power Bi to name a few.</description>

      <description>Are you a DBA or Developer and would like to get started with AzureML the EASY WAY?
AzureML isn't just for "data scientists"... Anyone can use it! And after this session you'll be using it too...
Disclaimer: Sadly, AzureML still can't predict what's on your girlfriend's mind. Nothing ever will.</description>

      <title>Choosing the Right Database for Microservices Solutions</title>
      <description>The past years have seen the explosive growth of large-scale distributed systems. This trend has changed the database world that is arguably without precedent in the history of the software industry. The result is a ompetitive database marketplace with a huge variety of platforms for us to choose from. But how do we go about making the right choices?

In this talk we will discuss how we can go about choosing the right database models for your application.  We will also look at how the choice of data models can help determine which technologies to include in your data tier.</description>

      <title>Score a (row) goal and beat a query optimizer</title>
      <description>Query optimizer is a magical piece of architecture inside SQL Server which instructs the engine how your query is going to be executed. It performs a great job …unless it doesn’t. 

In this session we will have a deep look on cases where the query optimizer fails and explain why is it happening. Expect to see a real code written by real developers which will be tuned just in front of you to perform several times faster. If you want to (or possibly need to) take control of execution plan, this session is right for you!</description>

      <title>Taming the Beast – How a SQL DBA can keep Kerberos under control</title>
      <description>The word Kerberos can strike fear into a SQL DBA as well as many Windows Server Administrators. 
What should be a straight forward and simple process can lead to all sorts of issues and trying to resolve them can turn into a nightmare.
This talk looks at the principle of Kerberos, how it applies to SQL Server and what we need to do ensure it works</description>

      <title>The Road to Autonomous Databases</title>
      <description>The latest version of Sql Server takes advantage of data science more than ever and that trend is going to continue. Three pillars of change are Adaptive Query Processing, Database Automatic Tuning and Intelligent Query Diagnostics. This session will give high level overview of these features and then will focus on performance monitoring intelligence available in Azure Sql DB/DW and standalone version of Sql Server. That covers Query Store and smart tools built on top of it like Automatic Tuning, Automatic Index Management and more.</description>

      <title>Moving eLearning system to the cloud</title>
      <description>In this session I will talk about practical experience of moving a legacy eLearning system to the cloud with significant internal refactoring to get benefits of usage cloud technologies. Also I will trace differences between  system design, implementation and major issues/changes in a 3 years of maintenance. Some technical details:
 - Migration from on-premise to AWS
 - ASP.NET WebForms to ASP.NET Web API  + Angular
 - MS SQL to MongoDb, cluster of MongoDb servers
 - 500 Tb of videos to migrate on S3
 - nearly 0-downtime migration</description>
