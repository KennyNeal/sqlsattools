      <title>Real-Time Analytics with Power BI</title>
      <description>Power BI helps you build appealing visualizations of your data. With ever growing footprint of data it is equally important to get real-time insights into your data. It can be as simple as monitoring a single metric or viewing real-time sales performance across multiple locations. Power BI real-time streaming enables you to stream data and update dashboards in real-time. Any time sensitive data can be a source of streaming data set like IoT sensor devices, social media sources, service usage metrics etc.

In this session 
1. I will dive deep into real-time analytics with Power BI.
2. How to build streaming tiles in Power BI Dashboards.
3. Demo using Power BI REST APIs.
4. Demo using Azure Event Hub and Azure Stream Analytics.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Lake Analytics: Leveraging the Modern Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>What you feared has come upon you: You’ve been happily building business intelligence solutions the traditional way for years; Finally, the big data curse has caught up with you. Your organization wants to exploit their big data along with their day-to-day transactional data. You are now tasked with storing all this in one place and working your analytics magic on it. You start wondering how and where you would store this data, what kind of hardware you would need and and how you would learn everything from storing to processing to analysis in a short time – after all big data is a different type of beast from transactional data.
Fear not, all you need to do is look to the heavens; with Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Lake Analytics, you could get started quite fast. After an introduction to Azure Data Lake, we will dive into how you could perform simple yet power analytics using methods that are familiar with Azure Data Lake Analytics.</description>

      <title>Data Privacy and the Data Professional.</title>
      <description>It’s almost a daily occurrence to hear about some sort of data breach. 
But what are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional.
As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens the entire concept of data storage become more complex.
Exactly what is legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how will it affect around the world.
We’re seen Microsoft give us tools over the years – like Transparent Data Encryption and Dynamic Data masking - to help with this sort of thing – but is there a better answer?
Come along to this session and hear how you and your team can lessen your chances of being the ones responsible for the next data breach.</description>

      <description>Data Visualization is the front end of every BI system, and getting it right is one of the most important tasks in a BI application. Good visualization will affect tremendously on decision making process, bad visualization leads to wrong decisions. In this session, you will learn how to choose the right chart of visual with examples of Line chart, bar/column charts, and some other main charts in Power BI. You will also learn some tips and tricks to control interactivity of visuals in Power BI. You will learn about specific features in Power BI that helps empowering your visualizations. Session is full of demos, and through that you will learn tips and tricks for choosing best colors and best visuals for your solution.</description>

      <title>Create Custom Visual using JSON and R</title>
      <description>Power BI visualization is a holistic visualization tool. You can draw most of the popular charts with it. However, there is always some needs for specific charts that may not be available in Power BI standard visualizations of the marketplace. There is a possibility to extend the visualization capabilities using R language. There are two ways to use R to extend the visualization possibilities. The approach was introduced in 2015 as “R” custom visual that you can draw chart by writing R scripts. The editor for writing R was not that was good and also the end-user able to see the R code behind the chart. The second approach for using R to have more chart in Power BI has been introduced in  2017 that is about creating Custom visual file (pbiviz file) using R and JASON language. In this seminar, I am going to show how you can create any custom visual by writing R codes. You able to create a custom visual that has a specific icon, name, and parameters.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Black Box - Why productivity projects crash and burn</title>
      <description>Like a building a bridge that collapses within days of its grand opening (if it even gets finished at all), sometimes our digital projects don't go the way we expect. Productivity initiatives are particularly fickle as we try to change the way that people work. So how do we make sure we can successfully become a digital workplace without it all coming crashing down around our ears?

In this session, we will share our stories from our time in the field experiencing the twists and turns that productivity projects take; how to have success in your internal project; and if you choose to bring in external parties, how to make the most of them.</description>

      <title>DBATools! The reason to finally start learning and using Powershell</title>
      <description>Powershell has been part of Windows for &gt; 10 years and has been part of SQL Server since 2008.
In spite of this the adoption among Database Professionals for use in investigating and managing their environments has been low.

With the release of the open source DBA Tools module from DBATools.IO, with its 300+ commands, the time has arrived for Database Professionals to embrace PowerShell and upgrade their skills to support the modern Hybrid environment.

In this session we will look how to download, install and begin using the power within both this module and Powershell.

No prior experience with Powershell required!</description>
