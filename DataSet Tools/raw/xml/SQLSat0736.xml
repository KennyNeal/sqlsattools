      <title>SQL Server and PowerShell: Let's Get Serious</title>
      <description>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</description>

      <title>Learn History from Temporal Tables</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016 came out with a bucket full of cool new features. One of them is Temporal Tables. SQL Server 2017 made some enhancements in this area. Temporal tables are basically history tables of the normal tables; that allows us to retrieve data from any point in time for every change such as updates and deletes. It does this all without any change to application code. In this session, we will see what the requirements of creating temporal tables are. We will see the demo on insert and update functionality and how to query historical information using new TSQL clause. We will touch upon retention of history as well. It has lots of demos and less theory.</description>

      <title>Getting started with SQL Azure Database: What you need to know</title>
      <description>Azure SQL Database offers a way quickly spin up new databases with minimal management requirements. However, the number of differences between on-premises SQL Server and Azure SQL Database can be overwhelming. Even worse, with DBaaS it’s not clear who is responsible for what anymore.
In this session, we will cover all the basic steps of getting your first Azure SQL Database instance spun up. We’ll cover common gotchas, like firewall settings and resource locks. We’ll also dive into some more advanced options with templates, allowing you to make your processes reproducible.
By the end of this presentation, you’ll understand if Azure SQL Database is the right choice for you and your needs. You’ll understand how it can simplify management and allow you to scale easily. Finally, you’ll have the confidence to go and create your own instance with ease.</description>

      <title>A Tour of R in the Microsoft Ecosystem</title>
      <description>Over the past few years R has been popping up in several areas within the Microsoft ecosystem. It was first introduced in Azure ML then later appeared in Power BI and SQL Server. Unfortunately, the benefits of the R programming language are not understood by many Microsoft professionals so these tools are not being fully utilized. I hope to change that for some with this talk.

In this session we will take a tour of R in the Microsoft ecosystem. We will show the different ways R can be leverage and present compelling reasons why it is a very valuable tool that you should add to your data analytics arsenal. No R experience is needed for this session.</description>

      <title>Screw DevOps, Let's Talk DataOps</title>
      <description>DevOps is the new hot topic for IT, but only answers part of the problem. This session and demo will discuss why data creates continual friction in the DevOps environment and how it must be incorporated into the solution.
Reasons for this solution is required: -Data is getting bigger and more complex -Security concerns around critical data is becoming more evident every day -Data is created in silos in many sources, yet consumed in just as many locations, including on-premises and in the cloud.

We'll discuss the tech, the politics and the challenges of bringing data into DevOps and how to do so more successfully with culture changes, tools, scripting, and virtualization.

Takeaways from this session:
1. Learn the five principles of Data Ops 2. How embracing a dynamic data platform can eliminate challenges and provide automation. 3. Learn the difference between containers, packages and data pods. 4. Learn how to bridge the gap between data and people, eliminating culture from the scene</description>

      <title>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From the Inside</title>
      <description>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has a number of metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks, and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from the smallest column up through an entire SQL Server instance and everything in-between. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We'll also demonstrate the new SQL Data Discovery/Classification and Vulnerability Assessment features in SQL Server Management Studio.</description>

      <title>Implementing Python in SQL Server 2017</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016 added R to the analytical toolset and SQL Server 2017 has added Python.  When looking at various lists of the most popular programming languages, Python always has one of the top positions.  This session provides an introduction to Python, including why it is a good choice for analyzing data.  
If you have not had a chance to review SQL Server 2017 yet, please attend to see some of the new changes coming later this year.  One of the features covers will show what is needed to incorporate Python into SQL Server and how Python can be incorporated in stored procedures to provide the ability to analyze data using arguably the most popular programming language to review data.</description>

      <title>SQL Injection Attacks: Are Your Queries Secure?</title>
      <description>Sometimes using dynamic SQL is the only way to write a query that accomplishes what you need.  But did you know that dynamic SQL statements can leave you vulnerable to SQL injection attacks?

In this session we'll examine how SQL injection works and how we can write injection-proof queries through a series of examples and demos.  We'll also look at why some commonly used techniques aren't as secure as many people think.

If you ever write or maintain dynamic SQL queries, or work with developers who do, then this session is for you.   After all, do you really want to be the person responsible for allowing hackers into your database?</description>

      <title>Analyzing Your Workload with Query Store</title>
      <description>I've said it before and I'll say it again: Query Store is a game-changer for troubleshooting query performance. Yet when I ask people who are running SQL Server 2016 or higher if they're using Query Store, less than half say they are.  If you fall into that category, this session is for you.
We’ll start by discussing Query Store configuration. Sound a little boring? It won't be. There are multiple settings that affect how information is captured and you need to understand them. Next, we'll look at the data. Definitely not boring, as it's imperative you understand exactly what gets stored (and what doesn't) so you can find problematic queries quickly.  
Lastly, we'll mine the data in Query Store, and mining is more than just finding queries that use a particular index, or those that access a specific table. We’ll discuss different workload characteristics and how they affect system performance, and how to use Query Store to better understand your own workload.</description>

      <title>Is My Application Bias Showing?</title>
      <description>Computers can't be biased, right?  I mean, it's just lines of code.  Yes or No.  Ones  Zeros.  Those lines of code are written by people.  People have life experiences that color how they see the world.  Okay, let's be blunt.  People have baggage.  And that baggage is seeping into your application, surveys and web forms.  
You've got an idea for a new app and it's going to change the world! Right?  It's a brilliant idea  no one has ever thought of it before.   You're working on the GUI for your company's web portal and you know just what information to collect from the user.  Are you sure about that?  Odds are pretty good that the information you're going to collect is a reflection of your life  your experiences.  
Learn how to identify bias when it seeps in, how to code to be inclusive instead of exclusive , and some quick tips  tricks to make sure you're accounting for all the users that will use YOUR application to change the world.  Instead of just the ones that look like you.</description>

      <title>The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code</title>
      <description>There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Git/GitHub</title>
      <description>If you manage code, you understand the struggle of choosing how you source control it. While there are many choices out there, Git has become a popular option for many development teams. While it has many strengths, understanding Git can be a struggle for developers who are not used to distributed source control. In this session, we will go over the basic concepts of Git, from building and cloning a repository to branching, forking, and code merges. We will use real world examples of how Git and GitHub can be used to manage global development teams. Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of how Git works, how to get started with their own GitHub repository, and some tools that can be used to manage their code.</description>

      <title>(Not So) Accidental Personal Branding</title>
      <description>If you have an online presence, you have a personal brand. Most of us didn’t intend to create a brand when we made our first websites and social media profiles. They were just fun ways to share our lives and meet people. Now, they’re networking and career growth tools. In this talk, you’ll hear about people whose brands helped them become respected developers, managers, and community leaders. You’ll learn how to use your online presence to advance your career. You’ll also pick up best practices, common mistakes, and tips for balancing professional and personal content. Intentional personal branding opens the door to endless opportunities. Come see how to make that happen!</description>

      <title>Introduction to System Catalog Views and System Dynamic Management Views</title>
      <description>System Catalog Views are all about the catalog METADATA in your database. Using basic T-SQL queries they let you look for objects in the database such as Tables, Stored Procedures, Functions, and more. System Dynamic Management Views let you monitor the health of your server instance and database, assist in performance tuning and diagnosing problems. Both can be core sources of information that let you do your job faster and better. Sure, on the surface they can seem rather mundane, but they can save your bacon when your database goes sidewise and you have no idea what’s going on. Join me as we begin our flight at 50,000 feet exploring many of the different types of views available and what they can provide you, then push the yoke forward and dive toward the ground to get a closer look at several in detail. But don’t worry, just as it looks like we’re going to crash and burn we’ll pull back on the yoke and slide in to a smooth landing.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Capturing Change for Data Warehousing</title>
      <description>There are many ways of detecting and capturing changes to the data in your business system in order to populate your data warehouse.  In this session we will compare and contrast several methods for loading slowly-changing dimensions in your ETL solutions, including SSIS design patterns, T-SQL code, change data capture (CDC) and temporal tables.

Attendees will gain a full understanding of the pros and cons of each of these solutions and become confident in choosing and implementing them in their own ETL solutions.</description>

      <title>Maintain SQL Server Performance Baseline with PowerShell</title>
      <description>Maintaining a solid set of information about our servers and their performance is critical when issues arise, and often help us see a problem before it occurs.  Building a baseline of performance metrics allows us to know when something is wrong and help us to track it down and fix the problem.  This session will walk you through a series of PowerShell scripts you can schedule which will capture the most important data and a set of reports to show you how to use that data to keep your server running smoothly.</description>

      <title>Grokking the Grammar of Graphics</title>
      <description>One of the most popular libraries in R is ggplot2, a graphics library built on a concept called the grammar of graphics.  In this example-heavy talk, we will learn about the grammar of graphics through ggplot2.  We will start by building a series of simple visuals using ggplot2.  Then, we will show how easy it is to add more and more complex functionality to our visuals, showing that we can incrementally add polish to our visuals.  By the end of the talk, you will have the tools to build professional-quality visuals in R.</description>

      <description>This topic sounds scary, but it’s not. Regardless of whether you have a small database with only a few users, or a large multi-tenant system, you have Locking, Blocking, Latches, and Spinlocks. Understanding what they are and how they work is the first step in understanding how to troubleshoot them. Deadlocks are a problem, but they are a problem we can fix. In this session, we will explain and investigate how to find and fix the problems that we see in our database every day.</description>

      <title>Applying Forensic Accounting Techniques Using SQL And R</title>
      <description>Forensic accountants and fraud examiners use a range of techniques to uncover fraudulent journal entries and illegal activities. As data professionals, most of us will never unravel a Bernie Madoff scheme, but we can apply these same techniques in our own environments to uncover dirty data. This session will use a combination of SQL Server and R to apply these fraud detection techniques, which include Benford's Law, outlier analysis, time series analysis, and cohort analysis.</description>

      <description>While Azure SQL Database provides the full feature of the SQL Server database engine, it is designed primarily for newly developed, cloud-based applications.  For existing applications running on traditional SQL Server instances, the cost and complexity of migration can be prohibitive.  With the release of Azure Managed Instances, much of the cost and complexity have been removed.  Join me for this session to learn about the differences between Azure SQL Database and Azure Managed Instances. Additionally, discover methods for migrating existing instances to Azure.</description>

      <title>Where Should My Data Live (and Why)?</title>
      <description>Long gone are the days where the only architecture decision you had to make when scaling an environment was deciding which part of the datacenter would store your new server. There is a dizzying array of options available in the SQL Server and Azure ecosystems and those are evolving by the day. Is “the cloud” a fad? Are private datacenters a thing of the past? Could both questions have a kernel of truth in them? In this session I will go over real world scenarios and walk you through real world solutions that utilize your datacenter, cloud providers, and everything in between to keep your data highly available and your customers happy.</description>

      <title>Building REST API using SQL Server JSON functions</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Databases both contain JSON features that allow data to be accessed for either reading or writing JSON documents.  This combined with REST APIs make it easier than ever for applications to exchange data directly with the database.  We'll demonstrate this feature using SQL Server's built-in JSON support.</description>
