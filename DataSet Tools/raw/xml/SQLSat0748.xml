      <title>Adding unit tests with tSQLt to the database deployment pipeline</title>
      <description>Any database change is a good candidate for breaking the proper behavior of the system. How to avoid this?
Unit tests at database level can help avoiding breaking the contract with the applications that consume data from the database, and also can help ensuring database correct behavior (for example: a stored procedure do what’s supposed to do, or a specific table indeed exists).
In this talk I will address the basic steps to introduce unit tests at databases using tSQLt. tSQLt is a unit testing framework the allow to write, execute and diagnose tests for T-SQL code. After writing the tests, I will explore how can tests execution be include in the deployment pipeline.</description>

      <title>Enabling Citizen Data Science with Microsoft</title>
      <description>In times past, Data Science was only for those elite few with a rare combination of skills including advanced knowledge of statistics.
Microsoft has been making sure that everyone can participate in the data revolution by giving people access to predictive API’s, in-database advanced analytics and drag-and-drop predictive experiments. All thanks to SQL Server 2016 and the Cortana Intelligence Suite in Azure.
These advances have given people with less knowledge of statistics and programming the ability to become what Gartner calls citizen data scientists. Should we be worried about creating fools-with-tools or should we embrace the democratization of data science as the golden age of data?
In this demo heavy session we explore Microsoft’s solutions to ensure democratization of data science and the possible dangers that lurk below the surface.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Factory v2 – SSIS Data Flows  Custom Extensibility</title>
      <description>Azure Data Factory version 2 (ADFv2) arrived in Sept17 with a bunch of new concepts and features to support our Azure data integration pipelines. In this session, we’ll update your ADFv1 knowledge and start to understand the true nature of scale out control flows and data flows. What’s the integration runtime? Can we easily lift and shift our beloved SSIS packages into the cloud? How do we embed expressions to achieve dynamic activity executions? Do we still need SSIS with the ADF platform as a service? The answers to all these questions and more in this demo packed session. An awareness of Azure Data Factory v1 is recommended before attending this session.</description>

      <title>Azure Managed Instances—Your Bridge to the Cloud</title>
      <description>Many organizations would like to take advantage of the benefits of using a platform as a service database like Azure SQL Database. Automated backups, patching, and costs are just some of the benefits. However, Azure SQL Database is not a 100% feature compatible with SQL Server—features like SQL Agent, CLR and Filestream are not supported. Migration to Azure SQL Database is also a challenge, as backup and restore and log shipping are not supported methods. 

Microsoft recently introduced Managed Instances—a new option that provides a bridge between on-premises or Azure VM implementations of SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. Managed Instances provide full SQL Server surface compatibility and support database sizes up to 35 TB.

In this session, you will learn about migrating your databases to Managed Instances, developing applications for managed instances. You will also learn about the underlying high availability and disaster recovery options for the solution.</description>

      <title>Using AI to write session submission to SQLSaturday</title>
      <description>Deep learning has been used to write new Shakespearean sonnets, to imagine new delicious recipes, write hilarious Harry Potter novels and even come up with new names for beer! In this session we will understand, what is deep learning, what are neural nets, what are the steps required to build a deep learning model and look at some of the great examples mentioned. 

We will then turn our new skills to the problem most speakers have! Writing session abstracts. Together we will develop a recursive neural net designed to generate new SQLSaturday session abstracts, entirely based on previously submitted sessions to SQLSaturday. Will we be able to produce a session you would have attended? Come along and fine out.</description>

      <title>Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!</title>
      <description>Have you heard about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)? Maybe you’ve even seen a session about it before but you still have doubts about how easily you can make something useful out of it. In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos - everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we will end up building a complete solution over the course of this session to prove that you can start from scratch and still quickly be successful.
Let’s see, how that goes… 

PS: Even if you have not heard about Biml but are still tired of manually building SSIS packages, this is the right session for you!</description>

      <title>Open Knowledge Platform Use-Cases</title>
      <description>Many of Open Knowledge International's projects are technical in nature. Its most prominent project, CKAN, is used by many of the world's governments to host open catalogues of data that their countries possess.

CKAN is a tool for making open data websites. (Think of a content management system like WordPress – but for data, instead of pages and blog posts.) It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data.

In this talk I'll go over some use-cases of Open Knowledge Platform implementations by the Portuguese Government, the architectural features, the difficulties and different approaches to solve them.</description>

      <title>Graph Databases and Solutions</title>
      <description>The modern connected world requires connected solutions, beyond basic relational engine - think about web pages connections, social media network communications or map path finding. 
Even though one can implement eventually everything with a relational engine, the bigger amount of analysed data is involved, the less probable is that your analysis will be done on time and with acceptable ease for the developers.

Graph databases do exist in the wild since 1960s, but only in the last 2 decades - with the advances of the internet, started to conquer wider recognition and usage.

Let's dive into this diverse world of graph databases and discover the new kid on the block - the GraphDB in SQL Server 2017  Azure SQL Database, which promises to allow you to expand and convert your workloads for solving modern connected world problems.</description>

      <title>Enterprise Power BI – Development Lifecycle</title>
      <description>When your development team is up to a certain size, and often no matter what size it is, you want to start following best development practices. 
These include things like source control, multiple environments, deployment processes, and governance. As Power BI content is developed using Power BI Desktop and not Visual Studio as most Microsoft BI solutions are, these things can get tricky. In this session we will look at what Power BI has to offer when it comes to development lifecycle. 
We will look at the different options available to the developer when it comes to source control, multiple environments, deployment and distribution of Power BI content. Lastly, we will look at governance and see how it is possible to secure the content and audit the usage of Power BI. 
For all these topics we will look at the capabilities Power BI offers and how we, in the company where I work, decided to implement it.</description>

      <description>So you’re a SQL Server administrator and you just installed SQL Server on Linux. It’s a whole new world. Don’t fear, it’s just an operating system. It has all the same components Windows has and in this session we’ll show you that. We will look at the Linux operating system architecture and show you where to look for the performance data you’re used to! Further we'll dive into SQLPAL and how it architecture and internals enables high performance for your SQL Server. By the end of this session you’ll be ready to go back to the office and have a solid understanding of performance monitoring Linux systems and SQL on Linux. We’ll look at the core system components of CPU, Disk, and Memory and monitoring techniques for each.</description>

      <title>Modern Data Warehousing - The Lambda Approach to Azure BI</title>
      <description>Technology changes quickly - patterns and approaches less so. As people move towards the cloud, there are clear benefits of adopting a polyglot cloud architecture employing a range of distributed components.

This session will take you through the pattern known as the Lambda architecture, a reference pattern for building data analytics systems that can handle any combination of data velocity, variety and volume. The session will outline the set of tools and integration points that can underpin the approach. Do you design real-time reporting systems? Or crunch petabytes of data? Perhaps you are adopting a cloud architecture and just want to handle anything the future throws at you? This session is for you.

We will follow the movement of data through batch and speed layers via Azure Data Lake Store  Analytics and Streaming Analytics before considering the serving layer with Azure SQL DataWarehouse and downstream reporting tools.</description>

      <title>Deep dive into Adaptive Query Processing</title>
      <description>Until SQL Server 2016, the Query Optimizer and the Execution Engine were strictly separated. The Query Optimizer produces an execution plan that, based on statistics and estimates, should be fast. That execution plan is then faithfully executed by the Execution Engine, even if reality turns out to be different from expectations.

SQL Server 2017 changes this! Three new features now allow execution plans to adapt to reality. Memory Grant Feedback increases or decreases assigned memory based on past experience. The Adaptive Join operator allows the optimizer to create two alternative plans, the best of which will be decided at execution time. And with Interleaved Execution, parts of the plan are even completely recompiled mid-execution, with much better cardinality estimates.

If you are more interested in how all this ACTUALLY works than in shiny marketing slides, come to this session. We will spend the full 60 minutes knee-deep in execution plan internals!</description>

      <title>A Gentle Intro to Multi-master Replication</title>
      <description>Whenever we have two independently updatable copies of a piece of data, we live with the spectre of merge conflicts. This problem has existed for ages, but with so much distributed architecture in the cloud era, more of us get exposed to the pain.

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) evolved as a way to accept updates at multiple replicas with automatic conflict resolution, and to remove such concerns from application development. Inevitably though, you have to apply a different mindset to data design.

In this talk, I'll cover the basic premise of what CRDTs are, a few example CRDTs, the kind of programming interface they expose, and a glimpse into their internal workings. While the literature in this area tends to be a bit academic, we'll be taking a commonsense approach, giving you a useful toehold into the subject for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Blockchain - The data platform perspective</title>
      <description>Popularized by Bitcoin, now with Ethereum  Co already at least in version 2.x. 
What is technically behind the ominous blockchain, what does it have to do with databases and data warehousing? Are smart contracts only interesting for the financiers? And why should you program contracts? In the first part of this session, we deliver the background, and not just technically.

In the second part we take a closer look at the bitcoin blockchain as a "database". Starting point here: How anonymous really is the whole thing, when everything must be visible to everyone? After a brief introduction to its structure, we load the blockchain of bitcoin (that is, all the transactions that have been done so far) into Neo4J, a graph database and look what analyzes are possible (and why does a Graph DB work better here? And why aren’t we using the new exciting Graph stuff of SQL Server 2017???) Visualization and further analysis we do with Power BI, directly connected to Neo4j.</description>

      <title>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree (from a user perspective)</title>
      <description>SQL Server® has many performance WOMs (Word of Mouth), especially concerning indexes to include:
•	keep clustered index width small
•	unique indexes perform better 
•	keep non-clustered index width small
•	compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
This session dives down and looks at important items within index pages of clustered, non-clustered, and unique non-clustered indexes using the DBCC Page command to factually document index WOMs.  The effect of row data compression on clustered and non-clustered indexes are also investigated.  The demos will ascertain how the SQL Server® optimizer might use them and strive to gain some insight from a performance advantage.
The session is 80% demos. This presentation will propel the layman to a new level of index understanding.
Performance! That’s what we are all looking for. Blast off with this presentation.</description>
