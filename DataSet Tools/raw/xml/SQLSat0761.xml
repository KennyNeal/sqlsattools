      <title>Real-Time Analytics with Power BI</title>
      <description>Power BI helps you build appealing visualizations of your data. With ever growing footprint of data it is equally important to get real-time insights into your data. It can be as simple as monitoring a single metric or viewing real-time sales performance across multiple locations. Power BI real-time streaming enables you to stream data and update dashboards in real-time. Any time sensitive data can be a source of streaming data set like IoT sensor devices, social media sources, service usage metrics etc.

In this session 
1. I will dive deep into real-time analytics with Power BI.
2. How to build streaming tiles in Power BI Dashboards.
3. Demo using Power BI REST APIs.
4. Demo using Azure Event Hub and Azure Stream Analytics.</description>

      <title>Building a Database DevOps Pipeline in the Cloud under 49 minutes</title>
      <description>DevOps processes encompass both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.

Continuous integration is based around automated builds and tests. Continuous Delivery allows both application developers, database developers and DBAs alike to deploy better quality code/software.  
In this DEMO heavy session, we will start off with source code only. 

Over the course of 49 minutes we will build a deployment pipeline that starts off with pushing our database and application code to source control. We will utilize Visual Studio Team Services to automate our build and tests and perform Continuous Integration operations. 

The output of these operations will be a standardized package of our built solution. 
Utilizing PowerShell in the form of Infrastructure as Code, we will spin up multiple Azure based environments that will be deployed to using automated Continuous Delivery processes.
The finished result will be an automated and reliable deployment pipeline that was built under 49</description>

      <title>Azure PaaS Databases - The Choice is Yours</title>
      <description>From the beginnings of Azure SQL DB, we now have Elastic Pools, Managed Instances and even MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB. How do you work out which offering is the right one for you and once you have decided, how do you then ensure that you are looking after it adequately?
The choice night be easy for the non-SQL Server PaaS, but the choice for SQL Server between SQL DB, Elastic Pools and Managed Instances can become, well, "cloudy".
This session will explore the features available to each option to help guide you through the first part. We'll then look at what to do once you have your PaaS database deployed – what can you use to manage it and what maintenance tools are available in the service for each flavour.</description>

      <title>Data Privacy and the Data Professional.</title>
      <description>It’s almost a daily occurrence to hear about some sort of data breach. 
But what are the consequences of a data breach – for both the victims and companies involved – and what does that mean for you as a data professional.
As governments start to legislate more in an effort to protect the privacy of its citizens the entire concept of data storage become more complex.
Exactly what is legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how will it affect around the world.
We’re seen Microsoft give us tools over the years – like Transparent Data Encryption and Dynamic Data masking - to help with this sort of thing – but is there a better answer?
Come along to this session and hear how you and your team can lessen your chances of being the ones responsible for the next data breach.</description>

      <title>Azure Machine Learning  Power BI - Perfect Combo for Predictive Analytics</title>
      <description>Is Machine Learning still a buzz word or can we easily put it to use to gain actionable insights from our data ?  
How amazing will it be to build visualization in Power BI forecasting the sales for a grocery chain or visualize property prices based on ML model ?

In this demo filled session, we will cover how you can find hidden patterns in the data, find outliers, predict results using real world data sets. 

AML is a cloud service which helps us to create predictive analytical solutions. Power BI is a powerful tool for both data analysis and visual representation.  Operationalizing the ML models thru the PBI service makes it a perfect combo.

In this session, we will build a predictive solution from scratch and visualize the models thru Power BI.
The audience will be equipped with sufficient knowledge to build, operationalize ML models and be able to apply to any real world data set by the end of the session.</description>

      <title>Tell me a story with Power BI</title>
      <description>“There are 2 ways to share knowledge. You can push information out or you can pull them in with a story.” – Quote by unknown
Great stories will pull people in, and they will enable you to share ideas, persuade others, and get what you want.
Power BI has some awesome features that take your reports from flat and boring to exciting, interactive applications, enhancing the practical experience and allowing you to tell a great story.
In this session you will see demos of custom visuals, bookmarking, visual display controls, links, spotlights, drillthrough and ‘what if’ plus other tips and tricks that will give you powerful intuitive storytelling capabilities and let you create better insights and organisational performance.</description>

      <title>GITHB 101 - An introduction to using Github and Git for Source Control and Open Source Projects</title>
      <description>In the last few years the requirement to understand and use distributed Source control systems has become an increasing part of a Data Professionals life. 
With the move into Open Source and community involvement even Microsoft has embraced the use of GitHub!

In this session we will investigate the setup and use of GitHub and Git for source control.
Using the highly popular DBATools open source project we will also investigate getting involved in an Open Source project and the process of Pull and Push requests!

Based around personal experience of learning not to hate Source control, this session assume no experience with Git or Github</description>

      <title>Creating Custom Visualisations with Power BI</title>
      <description>While Power BI comes with a lot of useful visualisations out of the box, and third-party visuals and R gives you a lot more choice, sometimes you need full control over what is being displayed. This is not for the faint hearted, as you will require Typescript and JavaScript skills and an understanding of the D3 JavaScript libraries, but there is a lot of sample code to smooth the way. 

This session introduces you to writing your own fully interactive custom visualisations in NodeJS, how to troubleshoot and debug, culminating in deployment of the Visual to your Power BI environment, giving you the ability to display exactly what you want in your Power BI reports.</description>

      <description>Indexing is critical to the success of your database, and it’s vital that you understand indexes thoroughly. You should know how they work in different situations, what kind of choices can work for or against you, and how to get the most out of them. This session will dive into index internals and demonstrate what’s going on behind the scenes as queries run. Using practical examples to explain the theory, we will take a journey from the basics through to advanced concepts that become simple when viewed correctly.</description>
