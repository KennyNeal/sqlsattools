      <description>I started as a night shift computer operator out of high school. I moved to applications development after graduation from SAC. After a few years with the State as an applications developer, the manager of Systems Programming decided it would be better to have me on the inside looking out rather than on the outside trying to get in. I spent the next 14 years as a mainframe system programmer for two state agencies. In 1996 I moved to Healthcare IT and have been that ever since. I’ve spent most of the past 14 years doing ETL, performance and HIPAA security. In these various jobs, I’ve used all manner of databases including InfoTec IMP, IBM VSAM and DB2, Interbase, Informix, Universe, Oracle 9i and SQL Server from 6.0 to 2008 R2.</description>

      <title>Data Wrangling for Reporting  Analytics using Power BI  M</title>
      <description>In today’s world reporting and analytics are no longer focused exclusively on internal data from transactional systems and the data warehouse. 
Mashups using data from partners, commercial and public sources are fast becoming the new normal.
Do you have a csv file too big to open, is a non-windows format or generates errors on import or opening?
Need to determine the quality of a file downloaded from the internet or supplied by another party?
In this presentation we will review tools to examine/repair schema issues and explore Power BI Desktop features that provide insights into your datasets along with the M language for building mashups and data models.</description>

      <title>Environmental SQL Server Troubleshooting</title>
      <description>When called in to diagnose a performance issue what are the 1st things you review? Many DBAs and developers make the mistake of diving straight into the code looking for an answer. However, often times the solution is not in the code but rather in the overall environment. Environmental troubleshooting is often a quick and overlooked method for discovering and configuring SQL Server to perform at a higher level without the need for application change controls.

In this session we will discuss both performance pitfalls and optimizations that can be made to the system outside of code changes. We will diagnose configurations commonly misapplied and review best practices in SQL Server, Windows Server, and VMware!</description>

      <title>Save Valuable Time and Resources - Job Performance Tuning Strategies</title>
      <description>We all know that execution plans and indexes are important pieces to performance tuning jobs. However, they are definitely not the only tools in the toolbox. This session will take a more high-level, holistic, approach to performance tuning jobs and their components. We will talk about where to start, how to identify problem areas, and many ways to improve performance. Many of the topics covered in the presentation come from real-world situations I've encountered. One example describes how we stopped a job after 13 hours and were able to tune it down to 8 minutes. Adding additional hardware is not always an option or the answer. Do more with what you have and tune your jobs. I'll show you how.</description>

      <title>Back to Basics - The SELECT Statement</title>
      <description>If you are going to do anything with data you are going to need to learn how to query data. And the language to query the majority of those systems is through SQL (Structured Query Language). The pull data from any systems you are going to be relying on the Select statement. The features in the statement may vary slightly from platform to platform, but the core capabilities are the same.

In this session, we will dive deep in to the SELECT statement as the window to getting your data. In this session, we will be using one platform, but the lessons learned here will be applicable to querying any system that supports a SQL language interface. This session will cover things like querying, joins, functions, aggregation, sub queries, and much more. This session will give you the foundation to start analyzing data in any database system.</description>

      <title>Power BI For Master Data Management</title>
      <description>Have you ever come across such business scenarios when you feel you have challenged your Reticular Activating System to find an “out-of-the-box solution for Master Data Management in your Reporting System”? Have you ever thought about a self-service BI system, designed and customized, only for your Master Data? Often times, in IT industry executives neglect the fact that 30% of their data visualization contains Master Data. 

Integrating Master Data Services with Power BI, and presenting analytics on top only Master Data, can provide a high-end leverage to your organization. Whether it is a location model, a product model, a customer model etc., executives can highly be insightful from a report that contains all master data domains consolidated with a better visualization. Using individual subscription views from Master Data Services(SQL Server 2017) in Power Query, and utilizing all the cross references entities across models in MDS – can lead to a great one page report via Power BI.</description>

      <title>Attack of the Linux Sea Monsters!</title>
      <description>Take a dive into SQL on Linux and take on some sea monsters that are lurking in your bathtub.  We'll take on the biblical Leviathan and answer: Why learn SQL on Linux anyway?  We'll hunt down Moby Dick by sharpening our harpoons, by using tools you're probably already using with on Windows.  After getting our feet wet, we'll go after the legendary beast, The Kraken, by leveraging your existing skills with Linux.  Don't be eaten alive by Jaws and all the new fast-paced piranha-like features of SQL 2017.  You can sail safely into the sunset by making SQL on Linux fun, memorable and learning lasting skills that will future proof your career.  If you can install, backup, and restore SQL on Windows in your sleep, then perhaps now is the time to jump in.  Be careful, you might get wet in the splash zones so dress accordingly or at least bring weather proof gear.  Anchors Away!</description>

      <title>Collecting Performance Metrics</title>
      <description>Have you ever had a manager standing over your shoulder, wanting to know why a server is running slowly? Or if a server can handle additional workload? What information would you use to answer these questions? How would you share this information with your manager? If only you had performance metrics from your existing servers to answer these questions. 

In this session, we will be combining three open source tools (Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana) into an inexpensive system that collects performance metrics you can use to troubleshoot and answer important questions about your SQL Server instances, including your SQL Server on Linux instances. We will learn what data to collect, how to use the tools mentioned to collect that data and then we'll put it all together in an interactive dashboard for easy visualization.</description>

Like other NoSQL platforms, Cosmos DB supports a schema-free data model, built-in partitioning for sustained heavy-write ingestion, and replication for high availability. But only Cosmos DB offers turnkey global distribution, automatic indexing, and SLAs for guarantees on 99.99% availability, throughput, latency, and consistency.

We tour many features of Cosmos DB, including its multi-model capabilities which allow you to store and query schema-free JSON, graph, key/value, and columnar data models. You’ll learn about global distribution, scale-out partitioning, tunable consistency, custom indexing, and more. We’ll also explore client development using the many available SDKs and APIs. Attend this session, and get up to speed on Cosmos DB toda</description>

      <title>Power BI Deployment Strategies:  The Business versus I.T.</title>
      <description>Microsoft’s Power BI service has allowed end users and business analysts to exercise their creativity as developers.  The expansion of department resources to create elegant and visually appealing reports for themselves and their organization at a fast pace, has taken some of the burden off developers, or has it?  
Are you hoarding your environment with unorganized piles of data to feed your wonderful Power BI reports?  In this life of point and click, drag and drop reporting, we sometimes lose sight of cohesive business standards, data integration and data modeling.
In this session, we will look at potential data management concerns that include but are not limited to; overlapping data, inconsistent naming conventions, undocumented transformations, mismatch data types and varying granularity.  We will focus on the importance of having a solid data model and managing data governance using Power BI as well as traditional tools and best practices.</description>

      <title>A DBA's guide to full stack performance troubleshooting</title>
      <description>Performance troubleshooting is a required skill for every DBA. Knowing the deep internals of how a query functions and why SQL Server chose to run it in a certain way is important. Knowing how to design a table or configure a database to squeeze every ounce of performance is our lifeblood. 

What if I told you that you may be doing this all wrong? What if all the work and laborious effort put into design or configuration don't improve the situation because the issue was never in SQL to begin with? Truth be told, the biggest differentiator between a good DBA and a great DBA is knowing the hardware and O/S; not just SQL.

Join me as I guide you through troubleshooting SQL Server performance from tip to toe to demonstrate the common performance problems you never knew you had.</description>

      <title>Reporting Services 2016: New Features  Smart Migration Strategy</title>
      <description>With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting Services finally got some love!  In this session, you will get an overview of some of the new features and functionality in SSRS 2016: A look at the new Report Manager interface, Mobile reports, KPIS and the new control we have over the placement of parameters.  We will also look at the new Mobile Report Publisher app and see how easy it is to take an existing report and make it mobile friendly.

The session will then dive into how to use the data in the ReportServer database tables to see which reports in your environment are being used and how well they are performing.  With this understanding you can determine which reports, data sets and data sources to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  Come see how to leverage PowerShell to extract the reports from the database, instead of having to download them from Report Manager, to facilitate an easy migration to a new SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services implementation.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to SQL Server Spatial Data</title>
      <description>Way, way back in SQL 2008 Microsoft added the capability to store and work with geospatial data types. (Wait...what's this you say?!?)  Well, yes...it's been there for quite some time now. You can actually store spatial data in SQL tables (in the form of points, lines and polygons). There are also many powerful, built-in functions that allow the manipulation and calculation of results around this data. This is a powerful, but sadly underused feature of the product given that IoT tends to be so focused around the location of things. 

Come to this session to learn about:
● The two elusive data types (geography and geometry)
● T-SQL Spatial routines and functions 
● How to load spatial data
● Spatial Indexes - how they work and when they're useful
● Where you can get lots and lots of free spatial data to supplement your existing systems</description>

      <title>Automate the Pain Away with Adaptive Query Processing and Automatic Tuning</title>
      <description>The way you tune your SQL Server workloads are changing.  In the past, you would rely on dynamic management views, execution plan cache, and server-side traces or extend events.  In SQL Server 2012 we were introduced to Columnstore indexes; In SQL 2014 the cardinality estimator got a huge overhaul. With SQL Server 2016 we were given query store to allow us to get more insight into our performance pains and execution plan changes. SQL Server 2017 gave us Automatic Tuning and Adaptive Query Processing to help automate performance improvements. In this session, we will harness the ways you improve performance into the new so you can automate the pain away and spend more time identifying and tuning pain points that cannot be automated.</description>

      <title>GDPR – New age of data protection and privacy</title>
      <description>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect on May 25, 2018 heralds a new era of enhanced personal privacy rights and adds additional duty to companies for protecting data. However, it’s not just about protecting the privacy of personal data of EU citizens. Data breaches such as at Target, Equifax, Uber and many others, result in loss of customers, loss of profits and cost executive jobs. A survey by Forrester reveals that 74% of individuals are ready to switch to a competitor if their bank or insurer suffers a data breach. Security and Privacy capabilities ranks as the number 1 initiative by 55% of organizations in a 2017 Customer Priorities  Journey Survey.

In this session, we will discuss all things data protection with the Microsoft Data Platform. Whether it is to comply with the requirements of GDPR or ensuring that your data is the most secure it can be.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure 101 for SQL Server Deployments</title>
      <description>In a cloudy, virtualized world where we have less physical deployments of SQL Server, those responsible for SQL Server still need to understand basic infrastructure concepts whether you are deploying on Windows Server or Linux. Without them, your VMs and IaaS deployments will not scale, will underperform, and most likely will have poor availability. This session will cover the basics of what you need to know whether you are deploying SQL Server on premises or in the public cloud to go from SQL Server zero to SQL Server hero and be able to have better working relationships with the other administrators in your organization.</description>

      <title>Understanding Parameter Sniffing</title>
      <description>Parameter sniffing is a good thing: it is used by the Query Optimizer to produce an execution plan tailored to the current parameters of a query. However, due to the way that the plan cache stores these plans in memory, sometimes can also be a performance problem. This session will show you how parameter sniffing works and in which cases could be a problem. How to diagnose and troubleshoot parameter sniffing problems and their solutions will be discussed as well. The session will also include details on how the Query Optimizer uses the histogram and density components of the statistics object and some other advanced topics.</description>

      <title>Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere. Doing it Right!</title>
      <description>For most DBAs virtualization is no longer a matter of "If" but "When". This means it is critical for DBAs to understand how this technology works and how we can ensure we get the most performance and scalability out of it. In this session we will look at some of the best practices and gotchas when Designing Standalone and Highly Available SQL deployments in a vSphere environment.  We'll also cover how to troubleshoot performance issues when they arise.</description>

      <title>JSON and the Astronauts</title>
      <description>In one small step, SQL Server 2016 has taken a giant leap...to JSON! In this session, we'll launch a probe into a JSON data file containing profiles of NASA astronauts using new JSON T-SQL functions in SQL Server. With each astronaut we meet, we'll learn to validate, read, and manipulate "unstructured" JSON data. We'll get The Right Stuff to start developing, no previous JSON experience required. Let's go where NoSQL has gone before!

Prerequisites:
You should have experience writing queries in T-SQL. No previous knowledge of JSON is needed.</description>

      <title>Time intelligence and date tables in Power BI</title>
      <description>Every Power BI model has dates and the need of calculation over dates to aggregate and compare data, like Year-To-Date, Same-Period-Last-Year, Moving Average, and so on. Quick measures and DAX functions can help, but how do you manage holidays, working days, weeks based fiscal calendars and any non-standard calculation’
This session provides you the best practices to correctly shape a data model and to implement time intelligence calculations using both built-in DAX functions and custom DAX calculation for more complex and non-standard requirements.</description>
