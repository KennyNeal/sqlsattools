      <title>Headless chicken - calming the sysadmin that turned DBA</title>
      <description>Last night you went to bed as a sysadmin, but today you are realizing with a rising dread that you have woken up as a DBA. It sounds like a bad dream, but it doesn't seem to go away. Maybe the previous DBA won a million bucks and quit on the spot or was hit by a bus and will spend the next couple of months in the hospital; the fact remains that you're now THE DBA. It really doesn't matter if you have a single database on-prem or thirty in the cloud - you've pulled the short straw and you quickly need to get up to speed. This session is a fast-paced, exciting and fun database primer for sysadmins. You will learn how to best feed and care for your new toy, where to scratch, where to kick and most importantly - what never to do. Bring me your fear and despair and I will give you the confidence needed to continue your new DBA journey.</description>

      <title>Making reports in SSRS: beyond standard tools</title>
      <description>Reporting Services is used by years as the main tool to create and delivery reports for SQL Server data platform users.
But although we are accostumed to use it, there are many tips and tricks that can help us to significantly improve the output we produce. For example:
- writing custom function to perform non-standard actions or to create personalized charts
- export multiple sheets in Excel
- dealing with merge cells when exporting in Excel
- using interactive and dynamics filters inside a report
- creating alternate rows backgrounds in tables or matrix
The release of SQL Server 2016 introduced support for R, the most common and powerful analytical and statistical language.
With R inside SQL Server it’s possible to embed R charts straight into Reporting Services, exploiting countless opportunities offered by the powerful graphic libraries shipped into the language.</description>

      <title>Automate your work processes with Microsoft Flow and Power BI</title>
      <description>You use different apps to organize your work. Outlook, Onedrive, Onenote, Sharepoint, Power BI and so on. All for different tasks. Microsoft introduced Flow to let these apps talk to each other. This allows us to create new automated workflows in an easy way. And the beauty is, you don’t need to be a developer!

In these workflows Power BI can play an important role. Power BI generates data alerts which can be used to create emails, work tasks or even start a new flow. Also, you can automatically publish data to Power BI from apps like Outlook and SharePoint to analyze your email and documents.

In this session we’ll introduce Flow and look at use cases to integrate apps with Power BI. By using different demo’s, you will get a good understanding how to use Power BI and Flow to automate new work processes.</description>

      <title>Data Wrangling as the key to success with Data Lake</title>
      <description>Self-Service Data Preparation aka Data Wrangling is becoming more and more popular in BigData and Enterprise world. Data Lake stores tons of different data and it is not easy to get value from it. Traditional approach doesn't work here, data analysts and data scientists have to wait until IT guys gather requirements and prepare a right dataset for them. Time from raw data to insights is too long. In this session, I invite you together look closer at Self-Service Data Prep and show how it would help to get insights and make decisions faster, onboard new data sources without IT, and increase efficiency for data analysts and data scientists.</description>

      <title>Not just polish – How good code also runs faster</title>
      <description>I want to show you how just a little neater and tighter code can also run a lot faster. These are some of the instant performance improvements that won’t change a lot of code, won’t generate weeks of testing and validation for your colleagues, and can be relatively quick to implement.

But most of all, they’ll make the code prettier and easier to understand for the next person.

We’ll look at common ways that null values, implicit datatype conversions and foreign key constraints can radically affect the performance of your queries. Inspired by an actual client case, where I tuned a 20 hour query down to a few minutes, with only a minor code change.

This presentation is all-code, some execution plans, and no-powerpoint.</description>

      <title>Natural Born Killers, Performance Issues to Avoid</title>
      <description>Learning SQL is easy, mastering it is hard. In this session you’ll learn simple but effective tricks to design your database objects better and write more optimized code. As an attendee you will gain a deeper understanding of common database development and administration mistakes, and how you can avoid them.

Ever thought that you were adhering to best practices but still seeing performance problems? You might well be. In this session I will be covering why the optimizer isn’t using all available processors, when the database engine fails to report all the resources a query has used and why the optimizer doesn’t always use the best plan.

You will leave this session with a list of things that you can check for in your environment to improve performance for your users.</description>

      <title>FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them</title>
      <description>Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduces a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous d</description>

      <description>In the current just-in-time world we want to analyze what is happening now, not what happened yesterday. Companies start to embrace Azure Stream Analytics, which makes it easy to analyze streams of incoming events without going into advanced coding. But for advanced analytics we need machine learning to learn patterns in your data. Azure Machine learning can do this for you. But the real beauty is that both products can easily work together.
So if you want to see how within 60 minutes we can learn patterns in streams of data and apply them on live data, be sure to attend this demo-oriented session.</description>

In this presentation, you will learn what actually means: you should normally write set-based statements instead and I will explain why they generally are faster than writing your own loops. But I will also look at situations where using a loop for one reason or another is preferrable, and you will learn that the best way to run a loop in most cases is exactly a cursor, provided that you implement it properly. The presenation also gives some tips how you can troubleshoot performance problems with loops.</description>
