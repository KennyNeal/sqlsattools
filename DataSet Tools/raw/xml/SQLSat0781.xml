Edit data, organize your favorite database connections, and browse database objects in a familiar object browsing experience."

And, it runs on a Mac (and Linux, and Windows, too). Similar to Visual Studio Code, SQL Operations Studio (still in pre-release form) lets you connect to and manipulate your databases without spinning up Visual Studio (or SSMS). We'll walk through how to get the bits and install them, then connect to and query a database (in Azure) - we might not even use a mouse! If time permits, we'll take a look at Code Snippets - a built-in capability to make your T-SQL coding super-productive!</description>

      <title>Agile Database Development and Zero Downtime Deployments</title>
      <description>Does your database development process match your agile front-end counterparts?
Is SQLServer Data Tools the right tool for an agile deployment methodology?

Join me in a fresh approach that will build deployments designed to be agile from the beginning, and also support the capability for zero down time deployments by supporting multiple states of the application, so database deployments can be made in advance, without breaking the application or requiring an outage.

We will touch on how about 35 different types of DDL changes can be prepared to support transition periods, so deployments can run against a live system with no disruptions to also support the next release of your application.

This approach is a new mindset, but with a few months of planning can be leveraged to turn a deployment from a feared event to showing off your true enterprise level DevOps skills. Some demonstrations will show how ReadyRoll can be used to build migrations that support transition periods.</description>

      <title>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for BI Pros: Automating SSIS, SSRS, SSAS, and Power BI</title>
      <description>PowerShell has allowed DBAs to manage huge numbers of SQL servers, all automatically. Now BI practitioners can reap the same benefits of scale and automation. Scenarios that are normally extremely time consuming can be done quickly, all with a few lines of PowerShell.
This session will be filled with demos based on real-life scenarios and use-cases. We will demonstrate how to scale and automate your BI solutions, with a minimum of effort. In particular, we will be covering PowerShell cmdlets  their integrations with SSRS, SSIS, SSAS, and Power BI. 
By the end of the session, you'll be able to accomplish in minutes what would normally take hours or days. You’ll know ways to quickly migrate and deploy hundreds of reports to multiple servers; or instantly identify and process stale SSAS dimensions. Additionally, you will also solve some pesky ETL tasks: deploying large-scale SSIS solutions, updating parameters for existing packages and streamlining data imports for Power BI Report Server</description>

      <title>A Beginner’s Guide to the Query Store</title>
      <description>With the introduction of SQL 2016, Query Store has become a unique tool in the DBA toolkit for its almost surgical like performance adjustment capability for systems.  This session will show how to use this feature in adjusting the performance of your SQL Servers in a much more granular way than the impact of using other performance tools that are available to the DBA - comparing and contrasting the Query Store with the traditional methods along the way.  It will also show you how to monitor the impact of your changes, and the changes in the environment, from using Query Store.  Finally the session will cover the basic architecture of query store, the reporting environment, and the DMVs that support query store.</description>

      <title>SQL Server R Services in SQL 2016 and 2017</title>
      <description>One of the most exciting new features of SQL Server 2016 is the integration of the R statistical programming language into the platform with the brand-new SQL Server R Services.  In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the R language and then look at how to install and administer SQL Server R Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of R by showing you how to create and run simple R scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use R to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of statistics!</description>

      <title>PowerShell for the DBA</title>
      <description>PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.</description>

      <description>There are many ways of detecting and capturing changes to the data in your business system in order to populate your data warehouse.  In this session we will compare and contrast several methods for loading slowly-changing dimensions in your ETL solutions, including SSIS design patterns, T-SQL code, change data capture (CDC) and temporal tables.

Attendees will gain a full understanding of the pros and cons of each of these solutions and become confident in choosing and implementing them in their own ETL solutions.</description>

      <title>Introduction to T-SQL Windowing Functions</title>
      <description>T-SQL windowing functions can simplify many complex queries. They are the best thing that has happened to the T-SQL language in years, but many database professionals and developers haven’t heard about them. 
They were initially introduced with SQL Server 2005. In 2012, Microsoft added several new functions that let you do things like pull values from different rows without a performance penalty. 
Attend this session to learn how T-SQL windowing functions apply to many real world examples.</description>

      <title>2017 SSIS Scale Out:  How and Why</title>
      <description>2016 SSIS packages can access data anywhere throughout the network, but normally run on the server they are deployed on. And if something terrible happens to that server, the manual setup of the SSISDB can be time consuming. With 2017, SSIS packages can be deployed once and run on several servers, even simultaneously. At this meetup, Paul LaGrone will teach you how to set up 2017 SSIS Scale Out packages so that your SSIS packages can now be in a Highly Available and Disaster Recovery environment.</description>
