      <title>Staatistical Analysis with T-SQL</title>
      <description>Transact-SQL language in latest editions of SQL Server has so many business intelligence (BI) improvements that it might become your primary analytic database system. You might even decide to use T-SQL for advanced analyses directly, without including R, Python, SSAS or Azure ML. However, to get the maximum out of these language constructs, you need to learn how to properly use them. This in-depth session shows extremely efficient statistical queries that use the window functions and are optimized through algorithms that use mathematical knowledge and creativity. During the session, the formulas and usage of those statistical procedures are explained as well. This session is useful not only for BI developers; database and other developers can successfully learn how to write efficient queries. Or maybe you want to become a data scientist? Then you need to know statistics and programming. You get the best of both in this session.</description>

      <title>Data Overview and Manipulation – T-SQL, R, Python</title>
      <description>In a real data mining or machine learning project, you spend more than half of the time on data preparation and data understanding. The R language is extremely powerful in this area. The Python language is a match. Of course, you do work with data by using T-SQL. You will learn in this session how to get data understanding with really quickly prepared basic graphs and descriptive statistics analysis. You can do advanced data preparation with many data manipulation methods available out of the box and in additional packages from R and Python. After this session, you will understand what tasks data preparation involves, and what tools you have in SQL Server suite for these tasks.</description>

      <title>Most common mistakes data scientists make</title>
      <description>In the middle of deploying the model, team of data scientists realize that the predictions are "somewhat-off". Troubleshooting on the horizon and what to do.

Session will guide you through most common mistakes data scientists and statisticians are making when preparing and engineering the data using
T-SQL or any other database system. Further more,  we will explore common statistical and data science mistakes when modeling data, extracting know-how from the data, finding the hidden patterns and running different test against the structural models using mainly R, Python, or Spark.

What not-to-do will be replaced with what to-do explanations using sample datasets and sample codes.

Some statistical knowledge or background is a plus!</description>

      <title>Data Science for beginners</title>
      <description>Data science can be hard to grasp, complex and big, but making data science easy to understand and bringing it closer to all who want to tackle this new emerging field is an important task in world of data.  Exploring, extracting and finding hidden gems  from data using statistical and mathematical methods, computer science and several different technologies is essentially what data science is doing. In practice this means, data science is an iterative process of harvesting data, managing and cleaning the data,  performing analysis and and at the end interpreting, visualizing and using information  that will bring insights to end-user, business people and making decisions much easier.
We will focus on answering 5 simple questions. 

1) is this weird? 
2) is A better than B, respectively? 
3) how much / many of this is needed? 
4) this belong to group A? 
5) what is next?

Session we will look into technologies that can be tackled using SQL Server 2016 and ML Azure.</description>

      <title>Најчешће грешке и заблуде на релацији програмер – SQL Server</title>
      <description>У овој популистичкој сесији аутор ће уприличити рестроспективу типичних грешака које праве програмери и тзв. софтвер девелопери приликом рада са базом података MS SQL Server. Неке од њих почивају на ограничењима и неконзистентности самог производа; већина је, пак, последица неразумевања функционисања дејтабез енџина, недостатка времена и/или потребе за дубљим разумевањем процеса оптимизације и извршења упита. Неке су, истини за вољу, последице и ограничења самог девелопера.

У сесији ће бити речи о узроцима грешака, те начинима за избегавање или ублажавање њихових последица, а пашће и који савет како да се побољша опхођење према овом веома респектабилном РДБМС производу</description>

      <title>Continuous Integration Pipelines With Jenkins, Docker and SQL Server</title>
      <description>Docker has taken the world of IT by storm and looks to be ushering in the greatest platform paradigm shift since virtualisation and the public cloud. The transient nature of Docker containers makes them the perfect fit for spinning up and then tearing down SQL Server instances as part of continuous integration pipelines. Jenkins is the most popular build automation engine in the open source community, it has phenomenal plugin support, it is used by the likes of Netflix and eBay and excels in its ability to handle build pipelines as code. In this session you will learn how a simple build pipeline that takes a SQL Server data tools project checked out from source code control, built into a DACPAC which is then deployed to a SQL Server instance can be extended to use containers, multi-branch build pipelines, tSQt testing and much much more.</description>

      <title>Beyond image classification - object detection  with multi-task deep models</title>
      <description>Object detection can be challenging to understand, mostly because there is a gap in the literature between image classification and object detection — the former is explained in deluge of easy to understand blog posts and articles, the latter is the subject of research papers, full of scary looking math.
In this session we will take different approach and built state of the art object detection model in easy to understand steps. First, we are going to make sure that everybody understand concepts of convolution networks, the importance of  model architecture and loss function. 
Then we are going to build a model that will classify single object, a model that finds this object on a picture, and a model that combine both and is able to classify and localize the largest object in each image.
Finally, we will move to multiple objects detection, discus latest architectures and design appropriate loss function for this task. All this illustrated with examples built using fastai library.</description>

      <title>CI/CD Database deployment</title>
      <description>Almost an every enterprise system needs a some kind of database in the background. In the process of development, architects, developers, they need to prepare and build a database. When the application comes into the production, can be a very difficult to move new changes and that slow down our process of release. Also, here can happen a problem with a bad script, a poor thing can gone happened and all goes into a bad situation. This is the right place for CI/CD process, helping to teams how to manage new database changes in a different environment.
In this lecture we'll see how to set up CI/CD process for database pipeline, deploy database changes into the Azure SQL Database and move that change into the production. It will be demonstrated how to include RedGate tools in the process. Also, there will be a best practices notes how to deploy a very large database.</description>

      <title>Minimizing consequences of data breach using SQL Server</title>
      <description>Intrusions into the systems have become so common, that there is no single day without news headline. User’s data, trade secrets, private habits of users are becoming the subject of "public" unauthorized access. Outcomes are blackmailing, loss of reputation and credibility. Database is a service that represents the last line of defense and as such deserves special your attention.

This session is about how to implement state of the art cryptographic features that are built in in to SQL Server (current version 2017). Focus is on the inside and outside threats. We will demonstrate the following : transparent database encryption, backup encryption, column level encryption and encryption data in the motion.</description>

      <title>Getting To Know SQL Server Encryption Capabilities</title>
      <description>With stricter EU privacy laws like GDPR, the need to encrypt data is greater than ever.
In this session we'll look at what SQL Server offers in this area:
1) symmetric and asymmetric server encryption which lets the server encrypt table data and control the keys, 
2) Always Encrypted (AE) which works similarly to server encryption but the client control the keys meaning server can't decrypt the data
3) Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) which encrypts your data at rest making getting data from stolen drives useless
4) creating secure SSL/TLS communication channels between your apps and the server to prevent clear text network traffic which can be observed</description>
