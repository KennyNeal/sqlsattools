      <title>Developing effective IoT back-end services with SQL Server and .Net</title>
      <description>In this session Peter Willmot (who has developed embedded/IoT and similar applications with SQL back-ends for many years) will help you to understand some of the opportunities that SQL (and, to a lesser extent,  .Net) offer when you need to design and build effective, scalable and secure IoT back-end platforms with SQL Server.

The session content covers various aspects of a typical SQL IoT back-end notably including:
- working work binary-opaque data streams using SQL CLR
- leveraging SQL Service Broker and Queues for CQRS and deferred aggregation scenarios
- consistent JSON handling across SQL versions
- selecting optimal data types and indexes for IoT-typical data structures</description>

      <title>Graph Databases and Solutions</title>
      <description>The modern connected world requires connected solutions, beyond basic relational engine - think about web pages connections, social media network communications or map path finding. 
Even though one can implement eventually everything with a relational engine, the bigger amount of analysed data is involved, the less probable is that your analysis will be done on time and with acceptable ease for the developers.

Graph databases do exist in the wild since 1960s, but only in the last 2 decades - with the advances of the internet, started to conquer wider recognition and usage.

Let's dive into this diverse world of graph databases and discover the new kid on the block - the GraphDB in SQL Server 2017  Azure SQL Database, which promises to allow you to expand and convert your workloads for solving modern connected world problems.</description>

      <title>DevOps, CI and the Data Warehouse [EN]</title>
      <description>DevOps and continuous integration provide huge benefits to data warehouse development. However, most BI professionals have little exposure to the tools and techniques involved.  John will be showing how you can use Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to build and test your data warehouse code and how to use Octopus Deploy to deploy everything to UAT and production. 

This is a demo heavy session which will introduce you to exactly how powerful DevOps can be in practice and will cover:

* Setting up Visual Studio Team Services to act as your build server 
* How to use Octopus Deploy to deploy your entire data warehouse 
* Developing a build-centric PowerShell script with psake 
* Building and deploying SQL Server Data Tools projects with DAC Publish profiles 
* Writing and running automated unit tests 
* The many problems of automating tabular model deployments 

Please visit John's blog for practical tips on how to apply DevOps techniques to your Data Warehouse: https://devops-your-dwh.</description>

      <title>dbachecks - Checking SQL Server environments with PowerShell</title>
      <description>dbachecks is a framework created by and for SQL Server pros who need to validate their environments. It is a free, open source module (created by dbatools team) that allows data pros to crowdsource our checklists using PowerShell's open source testing framework, Pester. 

We all share similar checklists and mostly just the server names and RPO/RTO/etc change.

We offer over 80 built-in checks. Imagine being able to easily ensure that:
- Backups are being performed within your policy
- Identity columns are not about to max out
- Database integrity checks are being performed and corruption does not exist
- Disk space is not about to run out
- SQL Servers are compliant with DISA, CIS, and more

Do you already run your Pester checks? No problem, we can run your tests too.
And to top it off, we make it easy to email yourself or view the results of your tests in a gorgeous Power BI Dashboard. 

Join us to see how easy (and beautiful) it can be validate all of your SQL Server environments!</description>

      <title>Continuous Integration Pipelines With Jenkins, Docker and SQL Server</title>
      <description>Docker has taken the world of IT by storm and looks to be ushering in the greatest platform paradigm shift since virtualisation and the public cloud. The transient nature of Docker containers makes them the perfect fit for spinning up and then tearing down SQL Server instances as part of continuous integration pipelines. Jenkins is the most popular build automation engine in the open source community, it has phenomenal plugin support, it is used by the likes of Netflix and eBay and excels in its ability to handle build pipelines as code. In this session you will learn how a simple build pipeline that takes a SQL Server data tools project checked out from source code control, built into a DACPAC which is then deployed to a SQL Server instance can be extended to use containers, multi-branch build pipelines, tSQt testing and much much more.</description>

      <title>Open Knowledge Platform Use-Cases</title>
      <description>Many of Open Knowledge International's projects are technical in nature. Its most prominent project, CKAN, is used by many of the world's governments to host open catalogues of data that their countries possess.

CKAN is a tool for making open data websites. (Think of a content management system like WordPress – but for data, instead of pages and blog posts.) It helps you manage and publish collections of data. It is used by national and local governments, research institutions, and other organizations who collect a lot of data.

In this talk I'll go over some use-cases of Open Knowledge Platform implementations by the Portuguese Government, the architectural features, the difficulties and different approaches to solve them.</description>

      <title>Shadow prediction: SQL spatial data types and astronomy well mixed</title>
      <description>Can you use GEOGRAPHY data types to calculate and display celestial phenomena and does it make sense? 
It needs some math and the willingness to use SQL objects for purposes, they haven’t been designed for.
This session is a (hopefully) entertaining exercise to combine scarcely used data types with a bit of astronomy and math to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbines (i.e. moving shadows that may annoy the neighbors) solely by using SQL Management Studio.
Only GEOGRAPHY data type will be used to show the richness and beauty of its functionality. 
 Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handled in SQL.</description>

      <title>Using In-Memory OLTP in Production workloads!</title>
      <description>In-Memory OLTP has come a long way since it was first introduced in SQL Server 2014. Many of the early restrictions have been lifted, but still fear and uncertainty of adoption into Production environments exists.

In this session, we will explain and demonstrate when, how, and where you should use In-Memory OLTP to improve your SQL Server performance. We will discuss using it in real-world production scenarios, highlighting administrator best practices, and developer use cases and considerations.</description>

      <title>Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server</title>
      <description>The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

Attend this session and you will be assimilated!</description>
