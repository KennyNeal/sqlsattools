      <description>Rick is a Microsoft Certified Master with more than 20 years of SQL Server experience in a variety of roles. He currently lives in Washington state and works as an independent consultant providing remote performance DBA and performance tuning services for clients in the USA and Canada. His first exposure to SQL Server was as a database developer, but over time he became more and more interested in how the database engine operated... eventually specializing more on performance issues than code.

Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.</description>

      <title>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</title>
      <description>Abstract:

Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?

This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Coverage:

1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>From (User) Story to Tables: Read Between the Lines to Find Your Data</title>
      <description>If you work in an agile environment, design requirements often come to us as stories with the phrase: "As a type of user, I want to ..."

For example: As a DBA, I want to be able to break down user stories to understand how they translate into our current database design and usage and have an understanding as to how it will affect future needs.

That user story is also the goal for the session. This will present one approach to how we can think about these user stories to find the data that we need to design our databases for. We'll even work through an example together. 

This is for DBAs who are involved in any part of designing databases, who want to practice how to come up with database designs, or who just another way to think about how they approach their database development in general.</description>

      <title>A DBAs guide to the proper handling of corruption</title>
      <description>Corruption can strike at any time. As DBAs how we alert, investigate, and respond can have profound impact on our company. In this session we will learn how to detect and respond to various types of corruption.
First we will be focus on ways to detect corruption early. This will include understanding tools available to us like DBCC CheckDB as well as the importance of testing your backups. We’ll also look at some sample scripts to automate corruption checks and common alerts we should have set up on our instances.
Then we will move onto how to respond to some common example of corruption.  We’ll look at how we can analyze the situation safely as well as point out various pitfalls that trip people up. We’ll also discuss when and how we may be able to fix corruption vs restoring the database.</description>

      <title>Case study: How we simulated a lights-out data center DR test</title>
      <description>Traditional DR tests may include application-specific recovery tests, or perhaps your workplace holds an annual "DR weekend" when you test the recoverability of your applications, and measure yourself against your own RPO's and RTO's.

With our applications now running in cloud, whether IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS, we typically must trust vendors' SLA's, and sometimes must design our own DR plan. 

This case study is a real-world story about how we decided to test our DR plans when our various applications run in the cloud. We used Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup Services, some Inf-as-Code solutions, a lot of automation, and some pre-configured but powered down infrastructure. I'd be happy to share our lessons learned.</description>

      <title>BI Infrastructure in Azure: Points to Consider</title>
      <description>Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors: 
a) Better access to data and 
b) Increased operational efficiency
How can you set up your own BI infrastructure in the cloud to address these? 
What components do we consider?
We can do that by proper selection of technology and vendors from Azure Market Place. How do we keep an eye on possible use of Big Data for your BI. We will also look at the best practices for doing so. We will take a fleeting look at some of the storage options for us in Azure and some Big Data concepts as well.
We will learn about Copy Data Virtualization in Azure Market Place that can help you provision terabytes worth of information in matter of minutes. 
We will also learn about setting up teams and ways to train them(and yourself) in this fast evolving world of Azure.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Backups and Restores For Fun and Profit</title>
      <description>Super-fast queries are an essential part of any business process, but speed will never be more important than during a disaster when you need to restore from backup. Come and see how both backups and restores can be tuned just like a query. In this demo-intensive session, we will discuss the different phases of the backup and restore processes, how to tell how long each of them is taking, and which are the easiest to significantly speed up. You just might be surprised how simple it is to achieve dramatic results - cutting your backup and restore times by 75% or more is absolutely possible using the methods covered here.</description>

      <title>Networking 101: Building professional relationships</title>
      <description>Networking.  You keep hearing that word throughout your career development, but you don't know much about it, much less, how to do it.  You want to connect with technical and data professionals, so you attend events such as SQL Saturday and your local user group.  But what about your book club, your gym, your church group, or your kid's soccer game?  Those are prime -- and overlooked -- opportunities to network!

In this interactive session, we will discuss networking -- what it is, why it's important, and where opportunities exist.  You will even have an opportunity to practice networking within the confines of our room.  You might even leave this session with new networking contacts that you didn't previously have!</description>

      <title>Database Project Makes Deployment Consistent</title>
      <description>The deployment process is frustrating; an object is missing, an object is deployed in the wrong order or an incorrect version. Deploying to multiple environments like Dev, QA, UAT, and Prod is a challenge whether on-premise or in the cloud. Source controlling database objects is paramount. Team development is required. Database code will only be deployed when changed. Proper security deployment will be repeatable per environment. Together, let us discover how using Database Project will help us with consistent releases. Deployments can cause you trouble but we will share a reliable deployment and version control process. Let’s see how Database Project can help us accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Python in SQL Server 2017</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!</description>

      <title>Tracking Index Usage Like a Pro!</title>
      <description>Effective indexing is key to query tuning, performance optimization, and resource management.

Knowing which indexes are used most (or least) often can help us determine which are no longer 
needed, or which could use some tweaking.  Keeping track of indexes that are missing and could greatly help performance allows us to solve related performance problems before they become disasters.

In this session, we will discuss how SQL Server tracks index utilization and the ways that we can persist this data for future use.  Once we have a collection process in place, we can easily report on it and make smart decisions using months of collected data.</description>

      <description>EVERY client I engage with is taught to RUN 3 SCRIPTS IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT THOUGHT AND WITHOUT DELAY as soon as a performance problem is noted. I am exceptionally good at performance tuning and forensics, but I (nor anyone else out there) cannot get at the root cause of a problem without information about the occurrence. These scripts will give you said information, which is very often transient in nature! I could be putting myself out of work teaching stuff like this! :-D</description>

      <title>The Case for Change: Identifying and Remedying Bad Code</title>
      <description>There is no organization that is immune from performance issues with their SQL Server queries. Sometimes all it takes is one "perfect storm" that kills your server performance and lands you in the hot seat with everyone asking you what happened. While many performance issues can be addressed with an index or configuration change, what about when the root of the problem is the code itself? Whether it's a stored procedure or dynamic T-SQL generated by an ORM, the burden of proof lies with the DBA to demonstrate how the code is negatively impacting performance. 

How do you capture those bad queries? When you have this data what do you look at besides the query itself? How do you make the case to the business that a code change is necessary? In this session we will explore capturing and identifying those problem queries, the analysis of the performance data, and how to effectively communicate your findings to the business to get your proposed code change approved and implemented.</description>

      <title>Documenting your SQL Server environment with PowerShell</title>
      <description>Do you know what your SQL Server environment looks like? Using PowerShell along with dbatools and PowerBI we will cover how to collect, store, and document this information.

Finding a free and simple method to gather information about my SQL Server environment was difficult. Using a combination of PowerShell, the dbatools module, and a PowerBI report I finally found something that works for me. I hope it can be helpful for you as well.</description>

      <description>Ever wonder why SSIS runs so slow? Watch SSIS author Andy Leonard as he runs test loads using sample and real-world data and shows you how to tune SQL Server 2017 Integration Services (SSIS 2017) packages.

We'll start by experimenting with SSIS design patterns to improve performance loading AdventureWorks data. We will implement different change detection patterns and compare execution performance for each. Then, we'll explain a Data Flow Task's bottleneck when loading binary large objects - or Blobs. 

Finally, we'll demonstrate a design pattern that uses a Script Component in a Data Flow to boost load performance to MySql, whether on-premises or in the cloud.</description>
