      <title>My Power BI report is slow: what should I do?</title>
      <description>You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?
This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.
At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Azure AI - The Art of the possible</title>
      <description>According to the Economist magazine, data is the world’s most valuable resource.  So, it makes sense that Data Science, Azure Machine Learning, and Analytics are all becoming core pieces to the success of every business.  As data professionals, we need to know how these core pieces will affect what we do, and how we can use the Azure AI suite to help our clients.  Microsoft’s AI suite is the central hub for learning and implementing each of these core pieces.  Using an easy to follow example, I will show the flow from problem to solution.  Multiple demonstrations of the different pieces will show use cases of the AI suite.  This overview of Azure AI will use the various pieces like a puzzle which, when brought together, will form a seamless picture of the whole so that participants can see that the individual pieces were meant to work together.</description>

      <title>Taming of the Shrew - Optimizing Power BI</title>
      <description>No one wants to tell a report user that while running a report in Power BI they have time to go get a cup of coffee…in another town.  Although data sets will often be the focus of performance issues, it’s important to know how to locate performance problems in Power BI and how to eliminate them.  

This session will take the Power User through how to identify time consuming processing in Power BI and how to address it through step-by-step and proven methods used to optimize in multi-tier environments.  This method removes frustration and finger-pointing and gets to the heart of the problem with a goal of correcting performance challenges.  The results are satisfied end users who get the information they need, when they need it.

Take Aways:
Learn how to identify what is taking the time in a Power BI data set and report.
Understand the logging and tracing mechanisms and capabilities in the environment.
Understand when a problem is really a problem.</description>

      <title>Power BI Deployment Strategies:  The Business versus I.T.</title>
      <description>Microsoft’s Power BI service has allowed end users and business analysts to exercise their creativity as developers.  The expansion of department resources to create elegant and visually appealing reports for themselves and their organization at a fast pace, has taken some of the burden off developers, or has it?  
Are you hoarding your environment with unorganized piles of data to feed your wonderful Power BI reports?  In this life of point and click, drag and drop reporting, we sometimes lose sight of cohesive business standards, data integration and data modeling.
In this session, we will look at potential data management concerns that include but are not limited to; overlapping data, inconsistent naming conventions, undocumented transformations, mismatch data types and varying granularity.  We will focus on the importance of having a solid data model and managing data governance using Power BI as well as traditional tools and best practices.</description>

      <description>Get ready for a wild ride as we identify  discuss the combination of Microsoft technologies which make up the “Data territory”, the offerings for BI/DW/Data Science practitioners. Some parts of the territory are ripe w/opportunity while other less-discovered parts are a bit hostile.

We’ll leave the engine running at each stop but spend enough time for the passengers to understand exactly what the various components mean. Throughout the tour, we’ll talk to the applicability of the components based on sizes of data (and customer). 

At journey’s end, the attendee will want to take action and their own path into Microsoft “Data Territory”.

Learnings:	
Attendees will have a more complete view of Microsoft’s SQL Server and Azure BI “Data Platform” offerings
Attendees can expect to be whisked into aspects of the Microsoft Offerings they may have never heard of or understood.
Attendees should be able to correlate the various Microsoft offerings to the size and scope of their own projects</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Services, and Power BI</title>
      <description>Microsoft Cognitive services is a series of services based on Microsoft Research using Deep Learning techniques, ready for you to enrich your unstructured data. Microsoft Services includes: Vision (Computer Vision, Emotion, Face, Video), Speech/Language (Speaker Recognition, Spell, Sentiment, Language, Key Phrases, Topic detection, Linguistic Analysis), Knowledge, and Search. These services are consumed by using the Cognitive Services APIs. Power BI enables you to consume the APIs to enrich your unstructured data inside your Power BI solutions. During this session, we will cover how to consume the API using Power Query to then visualize the results with Power BI visuals. We will also consume the Cognitive services API by using a R script inside Power BI. This session is structured with a B2C Survey case study solution with a real time Dashboard using a streaming dataset.</description>

      <title>Creating Near Real Time ETLs Using Serverless Architecture</title>
      <description>Demand for up to the minute data has increased as businesses leverage their reporting to make decisions based on current conditions. This requires a different type of ETL architecture that can consume individual events as they occur instead of bulk processing.

Azure offers several services to fill this need, to the point where the sheer number and variety of them can become confusing. We’ll take a look at these different options individually as well as how they can fit together to create flexible, scalable stream of data.

The focus will be on Azure’s serverless offerings, but other PaaS services will be discussed where they may interact with a serverless design.</description>

      <title>Should This Be Normalized? When Database Normalization Seems Abnormal</title>
      <description>Ever since database normalization was introduced as a concept by Edgar Codd, there has been continuous debate on how far we should go to eliminate data redundancy. A new developer may be asking why there is a need to create multiple tables, and a DBA may be concerned that performance is being sacrificed. In this semi-interactive talk, we’ll discuss 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms, evaluate the pros and cons of normalization and denormalization for integrity and performance, and run through some demos involving scenarios of various data model formats. All to answer the question, "should...this...be...normalized?"</description>

      <description>Data quality is a subject that comes up over and over again in many organizations. Most executives are concerned about the quality of the information used in their decisions. We talk about "good data" and "bad data" but what do those terms mean? In this presentation, we will first define what data quality is and look at how to measure it with data quality dimensions. Then, we'll explore common causes for data quality issues and how to perform a data quality assessment. Finally, we'll review the results and discuss some strategies and tools that can help improve the quality of the data in your organization.</description>

      <title>Applying Data Warehousing Principles</title>
      <description>Many data analysts typically begin to work with data as a single flat table. While this works for small datasets, as the size of the data grows these naive methods do not scale. Processing records takes longer, queries become more complex, and introducing new datasets is inconsistent at best. In order to solve these problems, we must take into account the underlying architecture of our data and how it should be modeled. During this talk we will discuss key concepts, patterns, and techniques for designing a data model that is simple to query, scales with your data, and is extendable to new datasets.</description>

      <title>Bridge Analytics and Developer Worlds with Power BI and PowerApps</title>
      <description>One of the Power BI most prominent strengths is that it’s a part of the much broader Microsoft Data Platform that spans various on-premises and cloud offerings for data storage, processing, and analysis. Join me to learn how to integrate Power BI with PowerApps and discover exciting new possibilities that redefine the meaning of a report. During this entirely hands-on, no-slides session, I'll walk you through the steps to implement a popular report requirement for writeback, that Power BI doesn't natively support.</description>

      <title>Whipping Away Stress</title>
      <description>Did you know stress releases chemicals into the blood? These chemicals give more energy and strength, which can be a positive if the stress is caused by physical danger. But this can also be a negative, if the stress is in response to something emotional and there is no way to release the extra energy and strength. Need stress management techniques? Stressed out? Learn how to cope and ultimately whip stress away.</description>

      <title>Little and Large - Cubes to Scale</title>
      <description>In 2018 creating a cube is one of the easier tasks in BI, however what happens when the cube you inherit is so big that it officially becomes the biggest cube in the Midwest, and therefore one of the biggest cubes in the country? This session shows how to handle tabular models of size and scale. It also delves into what assistance and considerations are required when considering moving, or even building, your cubes in Azure.</description>

      <title>Using Your On-prem Data in a Cloud World</title>
      <description>Microsoft Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Office 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Office 365 and SharePoint.</description>

      <title>Performance Monitoring Analysis Services Tabular</title>
      <description>Learn about how SSAS Tabular utilizes system resources and how to monitor its performance. 

You will see demos of how to use SQL Server Extended Events, Windows Perfmon, and SSAS DMVs to collect SSAS performance metrics. You will learn different options for storing and querying these metrics and how to use them to identify performance problems such as memory/processor bottlenecks. 

Finally you will see a demo of a set of Power BI reports that display the collected performance data.

While this session focuses on SSAS Tabular servers many of the concepts apply to SSAS Multidimensional servers as well.</description>
