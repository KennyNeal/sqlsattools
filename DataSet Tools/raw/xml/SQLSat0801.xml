      <title>Applied Machine Learning with Python</title>
      <description>The Applied Machine Learning with Python session covers some basic concepts, tools and a workflow used to explore, visualize, develop a model to attain answers from data. 

This is an introduction designed for those with minimal or no Machine Learning experience. It is also an applied session focused on getting answers from data, and it does not emphasize the Math behind the ML model. The examples use SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services (In-Database) integration with T-SQL, Python, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Library), MicrosoftML, Revoscalepy..

Most importantly, those examples are designed in a manner that are easy for you to understand and to spur your future exploration, by making it possible for you to replicate and use it to expand your knowledge.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Factory + SSIS: Migrating your ETLs to the Cloud.</title>
      <description>Thinking about migrating your data warehouse to the cloud? What about all those SSIS packages executing ETLs against your on-prem data sources? In this presentation we will discuss how to successfully "lift and shift" your ETL workloads to the Azure cloud. You will l learn how to configure and deploy an Integration Runtime, deploy and execute SSIS packages in an Azure Data Factory pipeline, and how to monitor and troubleshoot your ETL executions in the cloud. Attendees will walk-away with an understanding of the features, capabilities and limitations of Azure Data Factory and the Integration Runtime and a strategy to leverage your existing SSIS package development efforts to the cloud.</description>

      <title>I know what you did last transaction: Auditing using CDC, Temporal Tables and Triggers</title>
      <description>Attendees of this session at SQL Saturday South Florida 2018 voted to recommend it for SQL Saturday Orlando! There have been more advancements in the topic of auditing SQL inserts, updates and deletes during the past few years than in the nearly 30-year history of SQL Server. Eric Berkowitz presents a fast-paced, live demonstration and comparison of Change Data Capture, the new SQL Temporal Tables and conventional trigger-based methods. Gain the ability to audit, research and report on data changes, without recoding existing applications and proactively plan for auditing in new systems. Understand the overhead and performance implications and storage and retention options for each approach. See how querying, DDL changes and compatibility considerations vary among the methods so you can make informed decisions about implementing auditing in your system.</description>

      <title>Hack / Protect / Predict SQL Server - Come learn them.</title>
      <description>In this session, I'll show you how to hack SQL Server using a simple C# console application and other tools. Most importantly, I'll show you how to protect vectors that perhaps you're trying to use to safeguard sensitive data for GDPR compliance.
 
1. Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol
2. Dynamic Data Masking
3. Row Level Security (Yep...)
4. Database Source Control
 
Perhaps, you've seen these exploits before but do you really know how to reproduce them? Or, how to even protect yourself against them? No worries, I'll show you the way along with a load test.
 
Finally, I am very excited to share with you how to analyze text using pre-trained Machine Learning models to predict a sentiment, on-prem with SQL Server 2017.
 
5. SQL ML / AI - A deep dive to predict the sentiment
 
Looking forward to meeting you all.</description>

      <title>Tame Your Unruly Data With Constraints</title>
      <description>Bad data comes in many forms: duplicate rows, wrong data type, invalid values, and orphaned or missing foreign keys. Time is wasted cleansing, reviewing and correcting data, not to mention the potential hazards bad data can cause. This introductory presentation will explain the data types and constraints available in SQL Server, and how they can replace or augment business rules that would otherwise be written in application or procedure code. Performance benefits provided by constraints will be demonstrated. We will examine the various system views and procedures that describe constraints and how to use them to document your databases. You will be able to apply this knowledge to your database environments and see significant improvements in data quality, performance, and reliability.</description>

      <title>Supercharge Your Maintenance Plans..the Ola Way!!</title>
      <description>Today’s SQL Server DBA has a myriad of options when it comes to implementing their backup and maintenance strategies.  From internal maintenance plans to all-encompassing third-party solutions, the options are practically endless.  One very popular solution revolves around a set of free scripts provided by Swedish data scientist, Ola Hallengren.  These well admired scripts are used by corporations large and small worldwide in order to facilitate backups, integrity checks, and index maintenance operations.

In this session, not only will we introduce these scripts to those unfamiliar with them, but just as importantly, we’ll take a detailed look into just how these scripts can be extended and customized even further.  You’ll be amazed at the flexibility offered by the optional parameters.  We’ll also take a gander into the remarkably detailed logging tables in order to inspect the raw data and possibly turn it into a valuable reporting data source.</description>

      <title>Everything You Need to Know About SQL Server Indexes</title>
      <description>You probably already know that indexes make your queries go faster. But do you know all the different types of indexes in SQL Server and when to use them? Also with each new release of SQL Server, there are new features that can impact how indexes function and are maintained. Finally, knowing how the different types of indexes work can help you make better indexing choices when tuning your queries.
This presentation will review current SQL Server index structures and options, discuss how they work, when they should be used and how to maintain them. Examples of all the index types such as hash, in-memory, columnstore, filtered, etc… will be shown.
This presentation is a must see for DBAs, Developers, Application Architects and anyone else who is interesting in maintaining high performance SQL Server applications.</description>

      <title>Creating Reports and Dashboards with Power BI</title>
      <description>This session looks at both Power BI Desktop and Power BI.com to compare the advantages and capabilities of both platforms for creating and distributing data analysis within your organization.  It will also touch a little on why you might choose Power BI over Power Pivot and why you might not.  It will also look at how to create drill down detail screens to expose the details behind your visualizations.  Finally, we will touch on how to publish your Power BI results for others in your organization to share.  A basic understanding of database structures and referential integrity is an advantage to gain the most from this session, but as will be shown, not always necessary depending on the source of the data to be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Deciding to keep your BI Data Platform On-Premises</title>
      <description>The world is going to the cloud and there is plenty of good reason for it, but NOT every IT workload should go to the cloud and your BI is no different. Maybe you aren’t ready, maybe your organization feels fully invested in your current On-Prem infrastructure. Maybe there is some fear of the unknown.

The speaker will tackle these challenges and help you, the attendee, understand how and when to decide to stay On-Premises or move to a Cloud or a Hybrid solution. As an attendee, you should have the information to comfortably determine what is right for your organization today, and have a plan for the future.

Attendees will understand what On-Premises benefits are available exclusively to them
Attendees will understand where Cloud and Hybrid solutions complement their existing deployments 
Attendees will be in a better position to explore moving beyond their On-Premises deployment</description>

      <title>Twitter Data  Sentiment Analysis: Staring Logic Apps, Azure ML, Twitter Data, Power BI, and Python</title>
      <description>A year ago we went to Spider-man: Homecoming.  On the way home I thought “I wonder what the rest of the world thinks of this movie?  I wonder what people on Twitter are saying?  I wonder if this is that tied to box office performance?”  Over the last six months we’ve been building data sets on movies and collecting sentiment analysis of Twitter data.  This lead to a journey of data discovery.  First to figure out how to capture and analyze social media data from Twitter.  Next we needed box office information.  After that we wanted to capture sentiment.  Then we wanted stock market data.  Then we wanted movie information, runtime, rating, Metacritic score, IMDB score, and then how do we get historical data if we want to increase our data set?  Once you collect the data how do you store it?  How do you display it?  All this and more….. but probably just this….because that’s a lot.</description>

      <title>The Changing Role of CIOs and the Value of DevOps</title>
      <description>DevOps practices are a powerful tools to build productive, engaged teams who constantly learn and regularly deliver value to their customers. High DevOps performers report greater workplace satisfaction than their peers. But implementing DevOps isn’t a matter of being great at writing code, or choosing the right technologies: to become a high DevOps performer, you need the powerful catalyst of executive support. In this talk, we will discuss the value of DevOps from the perspectives of CEOs, CIOs/CTOs, and Managers. We will explore how the role of CIOs and CTOs are undergoing a major transformation, and how DevOps aligns with that transformation. You will leave the session with a fresh take on how to discuss DevOps with company leaders, and an understanding of how to explain the value of DevOps to people in these roles.</description>

      <title>Thinking in SQL</title>
      <description>SQL is conceptually different than most programming languages. Join us for a conversation about SQL, why it's different from traditional procedural languages, and how to effectively use this truly elegant programming language. Rather than focus on the kinds of information easily located on the Web, we'll concentrate on how to use SQL for the tasks that it's really good at. Beginners will get a great introduction to the style of thought that gets the most out of SQL. Experienced developers will find a good refresher and an opportunity to share their experiences with others.</description>

      <title>Intro Into Index Analysis</title>
      <description>Indexing in SQL Server is both - art and science. It is also never-ending process. Database schema, queries and workload change overtime, making old indexing strategy obsolete and leaving you with inefficient or unused indexes.  

In this session, Dmitri demonstrates several techniques that help you to perform index analysis in the system. You would learn how to detect unused and inefficient indexes, identify incorrect clustered indexes and choose the right candidates for consolidation and further index refactoring.</description>

      <description>Performance tuning a production system can be a difficult process when only relying on out of the box tools.  This is even more difficult if you aren’t on the most recent release of SQL Server.  In this presentation I will show you some common performance problems and how SQLGrease can help tune these.  Along the way I will provide details on how SQLGrease collects its data in order to give some clarity on how we monitor as well as provide some useful queries you can use even if you aren’t a SQLGrease user.</description>

      <title>Tally Ho! -- Explore the Varied Uses of Tally Tables</title>
      <description>Because SQL Server is designed to efficiently operate with set-based queries it does not perform as well with loops and cursors. However there are situations where you really need some type of a loop. Tally tables give you the best of both worlds by allowing you to effectively "loop" through records in a set-based manner.  We'll explore what tally tables are, how they work, and more importantly review some of the many ways you can use them to turn your loops and cursors into efficient set-based operations.</description>

      <title>Azure Resource Management with PowerShell</title>
      <description>You’re company is transitioning to the Cloud. Initially, your Azure deployment was small and could be managed primarily via the Azure portal but now it spans the globe with implementations in several countries. You have too many resources to manage with the Azure portal alone. You can automate these tasks with PowerShell without being a PowerShell expert. I’m Ronald Dameron. I’m responsible for managing the resources of twelve Azure subscriptions containing hundreds of resources. I can show you how. I’ve done it.</description>

      <title>Will my workload run faster with In-Memory OLTP?</title>
      <description>There are compelling reasons to consider deploying In-Memory OLTP, vastly improved in SQL 2016 and SQL 2017, and now running on all editions. 

What are the use cases? 

What are the tradeoffs? 

We will lift the veil of confusion that surrounds this blazingly fast feature. By the end of the session, you will understand how In-Memory OLTP works and whether your workload is likely to see an increase in performance.</description>
