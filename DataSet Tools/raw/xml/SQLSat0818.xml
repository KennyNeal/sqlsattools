      <title>Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!</title>
      <description>Have you heard about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)? Maybe you’ve even seen a session about it before but you still have doubts about how easily you can make something useful out of it. In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos - everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we will end up building a complete solution over the course of this session to prove that you can start from scratch and still quickly be successful.
Let’s see, how that goes… 

PS: Even if you have not heard about Biml but are still tired of manually building SSIS packages, this is the right session for you!</description>

      <title>GITHB 101 - An introduction to using Github and Git for Source Control and Open Source Projects</title>
      <description>In the last few years the requirement to understand and use distributed Source control systems has become an increasing part of a Data Professionals life. 
With the move into Open Source and community involvement even Microsoft has embraced the use of GitHub!

In this session we will investigate the setup and use of GitHub and Git for source control.
Using the highly popular DBATools open source project we will also investigate getting involved in an Open Source project and the process of Pull and Push requests!

Based around personal experience of learning not to hate Source control, this session assume no experience with Git or Github</description>

      <title>AIOps for Sql Server - Introduction</title>
      <description>For years we have been bombarded with AI-enabled/smart/intelligent features, tools and platforms. But what does it actually mean for Sql Server developers and DBAs in practical terms? Is it just marketing hype or contrary - distinct trend that has already started and impacts how and what we do, our workplaces and future careers? This session defines what AIOPs is, provides framework to measure AI, goes through the list and evaluates 'the latest and greatest' tools and features available in Sql Server both on-premises and in the cloud and finally shows practical use cases of the best of them that we have to adopt to stay relevant on increasingly competitive market. Let's find out if maintenance free, self-healing, auto-tuning databases that are able to detect and automatically mitigate security risks are ready for real-world workloads! Areas covered:
- Conditional Access VS Thread Detection
- Query Store and Automatic Tuning
- Intelligent Query Processing</description>

      <title>Become a SQL Ninja: SQL Server Tools</title>
      <description>In this session I will walk through some of the out-of-box SQL Server tools that you will need to know or never knew could be so much fun. A number of commandline utilities exist with SQL Server that we are never exposed to. In this session, I will take a tour of each of these tools and the scenario’s that real world customers used them in innovative ways. From SQL Server Management Studio to every tools will be an hour of Demo extravaganza not to be missed. This is a Zero slide but an hour of demo marathon.</description>

      <title>Common TSQL Mistakes</title>
      <description>We are going to examine a variety of oopsies MANY developers fall prey too - some obvious, some pretty subtle and some down right sneaky! Lots of code examples with the bad AND good code presented. I GUARANTEE that you will find things here that will either prevent you from getting bad data, throwing unwanted errors or vastly improving your database application's performance.  I have given this talk over 100 times now and it is always very highly rated!</description>

      <title>SQL Server Big Data Clusters - A game changer?</title>
      <description>With SQL Server 2019, Microsoft is introducing a new couple of features for data virtualization, data mart scale out and big data analysis. They all together for the SQL Server Big Data Clusters.

Let's take a look at what that means and how you can make use of the extended polybase capabilities, built in spark queries and more!</description>

      <title>Know What Your Code is Doing to SQL Server!</title>
      <description>ORMs - oh how I LOVE them! As a consultant, when I see them in play at a client I go KACHIIINNNNGGGG!! :-D Seriously though, they can provide some substantial benefits for coding throughput. But if you don't Read The Fine Manual and do some things right and avoid some major gotchas you will fall prey to one of my favorite Guruisms: "Anything that allows developers to slap code together more quickly is inversely proportional to the performance, concurrency and scalability you will get from that code"! Although this talk is based on Entity Framework, all ORMs suffer from the same flaws.</description>
