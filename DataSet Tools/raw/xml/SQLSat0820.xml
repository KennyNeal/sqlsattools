      <title>Your BI Workloads and How They Change in the Cloud (Azure)</title>
      <description>Your organization has made a conscious choice that everything should move to the cloud! You own the current BI workloads for your business and you are not sure what that means? 

If so, this session is for you where we explore in depth the workloads around ETL/ELT, Data Management, Analysis Services to support BI for your users. We’ll also talk data security, governance  managing your data outside of your 4 walls.

With plenty of ground to cover and an expected level of participation from the audience, this will be a fast paced session with insights into how you can retain aspects of what you have while pursuing the greater opportunities delivering BI on the Cloud affords you.

Attendees will understand what workloads are similar as they move to the cloud
Attendees will develop an appreciation for the benefits the cloud can offer to their BI deployment
Attendees should have the confidence to map out their own plans for making the most of the workloads they’ll change when they move.</description>

      <title>Creating Reports and Dashboards with Power BI</title>
      <description>This session looks at both Power BI Desktop and Power BI.com to compare the advantages and capabilities of both platforms for creating and distributing data analysis within your organization.  It will also touch a little on why you might choose Power BI over Power Pivot and why you might not.  It will also look at how to create drill down detail screens to expose the details behind your visualizations.  Finally, we will touch on how to publish your Power BI results for others in your organization to share.  A basic understanding of database structures and referential integrity is an advantage to gain the most from this session, but as will be shown, not always necessary depending on the source of the data to be analyzed.</description>

      <description>Are you uncertain about the health and capacity of your SQL Server? Are you taking over a new server and need to get a better understanding of the health of the server? Are you uncertain if your servers are following industry best practices?

In this session we will start by discussing the importance of performing a Health Check. We will then show how to run the popular Blitz script by Brent Ozar. After that we will review the other key areas to check like the VM configuration, Windows Configuration, SQL Configuration, Security configuration, and Database configuration. Finally, we’ll show how to save the results for capacity and trending analysis

At the end of the session you will be able to: (1) Perform a Health Check on a server; (2) List the key areas for improvement; (3) Save the results for capacity and trending analysis.</description>

      <title>Database Design Fundamentals</title>
      <description>Data should be easy to work with in SQL Server if the database has been organized as close as possible to the standards of normalization that have been proven for many years, but are often thought of as old-fashioned. Many common T-SQL programming "difficulties" are the result of struggling against these standards and can be avoided by understanding the requirements, applying normalization, as well as a healthy dose of simple common sense. In this session I will give an overview of how to design a relational database, allowing you to work with the data structures instead of against them. This will let you use SQL naturally, enabling the query engine internals to optimize your output needs without you needing to spend a lot of time thinking about it. This will mean less time trying to figure out why SUBSTRING(column,3,1) = 'A' is killing your performance, and more time for solving the next customer problem.</description>

      <title>Climbing the SQL Server Index B-Tree</title>
      <description>You’ll find a lot of Word of Mouth (WOM) advice out there about SQL Server performance, especially
when it comes to indexes. Some of the things you have probably heard are:
- keep clustered index width small
- unique indexes perform better
- keep non-clustered index width small
- compressed indexes have fewer logical reads
- add one index for each column

But how do you know if this advice is good or bad? Did you know that there is a way to look under the hood at the actual index pages to see how the data is stored, and how it’s stored differently when data is compressed? Using this information, you can prove or disprove the WOM advice.
Attend this demo-heavy session to learn how the SQL Server optimizer uses indexes. It’s all about
performance, and the right indexes will give your application a big performance advantage.</description>

      <title>Relational Design Critique</title>
      <description>The process of designing a relational database is not overly complex, and may be done by almost anyone on the development team. The process requires one to take the time to understand the requirements, when they exist, and apply a straightforward set of transforms to produce table structures that meets the needs. The tough part is that the process requires time and experience, neither of which anyone has enough of. In this session, to help the attendee differentiate right-enough designs from overly simple or overly complex designs, we will look at a variety of database snippets, each inspired from a real life design. We will discuss the pros and cons of the approach taken, and consider possible remediations to learn from a failure that was made by someone else.</description>

      <title>Accessibility Concerns of Reporting Style with Power BI</title>
      <description>Reports are no longer just black and white columns and rows of numbers. Reports combine tables with charts, KPIs and more. There is a lot to be concerned about when designing reports to provide information to your audience. Today, your company can face lawsuits if your reports are not accessible to all users.  You must consider the way you display your data, the amount of data displayed, the use of color and maybe even the use of animation. Creating attractive reports is not just about making them pretty. It is about grabbing your audience's attention. It is making sure you don't inadvertently introduce accessibility problems that limit who can receive your message, your data. This session while looking at some reporting best practices will also give you information to steer you clear of accessibility concerns to insure access to your results by all consumers of your report.  (Note: Accessibility is governed through the guidelines of the American Disabilities Act)</description>

      <description>Has your manager come to you and said "I expect the SQL Server machines to have zero downtime?" Have you been told to make your environment "Always On" without any guidance (or budget) as to how to do that or what that means? This session will walk you through the high availability options in on-premises SQL Server, the high availability options in Azure SQL Database, and how those can be combined to enable you to achieve the ambitious goals of your management. Beyond the academic knowledge, we'll discuss real world case studies covering exactly how your on-premises environments and Azure services can work together to keep your phone quiet at night.</description>

      <title>Yes! Making Performance Tuning Easier with Query Store</title>
      <description>In our day-to-day struggles with performance issues we use built-in and third-party tools to discover and analyze what went wrong with a particular query or stored procedure and then we try to fix them. However, sometimes we wish that there would be a way to keep a good historical baseline for comparison.  Microsoft introduced query store in SQL Server 2016 to help with these challenges and answers some of the obvious performance questions. In this session, we will demonstrate how to use query store to characterize your workload and more easily find and fix some of the problem you may have with your unruly queries and gigantic store procedures.</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</title>
      <description>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

      <title>Five Availability Group Issues That May Ruin Your Day</title>
      <description>AlwaysOn Availability Groups have become the most common High Availability technology used with SQL Server. It provides protection at the database group level, and it stores a separate copy of each database on each node, eliminating storage from being a single point of failure.

While Availability Groups help to achieve required High Availability, they may also introduce issues in the system. In this session, Dmitri will discuss several less known problems associated with them. You will learn how Availability Groups may impact transaction log truncation and contribute to the blocking in the system, how readable secondaries may increase CPU and I/O load on primaries among a few other things. Dmitri will also discuss how to properly setup monitoring for Availability Group infrastructure in your environment.</description>

      <title>Classification With Naive Bayes</title>
      <description>The Naïve Bayes series of algorithms are some of the simplest classification algorithms, but they tend to offer reasonably good results very quickly for a number of problems, including Natural Language Processing problems such as spam classification, as well as more classical feature-driven classification.  In this talk, we will look at the math behind Naïve Bayes classification, solving problems by hand before looking at a package in R which solves the problem for us.  By the end of this talk, you should be able to apply Naïve Bayes to existing problems.  No experience with statistics is required, although there will be a small amount of math.</description>

      <description>DBA’s, Did you know that SQL Server has a built-in way of collecting system and performance information on your SQL servers in one central location? Leave the Darkside and take this journey to see how the Management Data Warehouse (MDW) is created, Data Collectors are setup, and looking at the included reports to answer your questions like What are my most expensive queries (CPU, IO, or duration)? What is my SQL Server waiting on? Which are the fastest growing databases? Knowledge is power of the force where the MDW can help with proactive query tuning, historical query analysis, performance baselining, database growth forecasting, and storage planning.</description>

      <description>Many of us have attended career advancement or women in technology panels where they only tell you how to become part of the C-level, (CTO, CIO, CDO or even CEO).  Although these sessions may focus on valuable skills, they often require the individual to move away from technical work to advance.  
What does it say about the world of tech if the only way up is to give up the part of tech you love the most?
This panel session is for the women, (and men) who want to know how to make the most of the career they have and get ahead in technology without having to give up the technology they love.  
The panel will be led by Kellyn Pot’Vin-Gorman, who’s made a career from deeply technical positions and rose to the top of the Oracle world as a Multi-platform Database Administrator/Developer, recently becoming a part of Microsoft as a Data Platform Architect.  She will be joined by a group of panelists in various stages of their career to share their experiences, insight and advice.</description>

      <title>T-SQL Dynamic Duo: Window Functions and Common Table Expressions (CTE)</title>
      <description>Life and movies have great dynamic duos: Hans Solo and Chewy, Bogey and Bacall, Batman and Robin, Red Wine and Dark Chocolate (my personal favorite) to name a few; now let me introduce you to another Dynamic Duo: Window Functions and CTEs.  Don’t confuse Window functions with the Windows operating system; Window functions are ANSI standard T-SQL functions used in writing queries.  Common Table Expressions (CTE) specifies a temporary named result set and are leveraged as a way to filter Window functions.
Window functions supercharge your code to show detail and aggregate level data in the same SELECT statement without grouping, easily creates running totals, computes percentages, de-dups data and more.  We’ll see how using the Offset functions enables you to include different values without using a self-join.  There’s much to see and learn in this demo packed session, I hope you’ll join me for another adventure!</description>

      <title>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</title>
      <description>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</description>

      <title>A Primer on SQL Server Clustered Index Architecture</title>
      <description>How often when creating a new table you just made the Clustered Index using an Integer column with Identity properties.  Seems like that is all I have done for last many years.  But, in the last two years I’ve really dove into indexes and finally with this presentation looked at what really makes a good Clustered Index with benchmarks and varying scenarios.  In some scenarios a well-defined clustered index may out perform a covering non-clustered index.  Results are very interesting and may surprise you.</description>

      <title>Is my SQL Server having Memory Pressure?</title>
      <description>As we all know, SQL Server loves memory and will use as much as it can get.  However, when there is memory pressure we need to use our DBA skills to identify what is causing the pressure.  During this session we will explore how SQL Server uses memory and how to properly configure memory settings.  We will discuss the use of DMVs and other tools to help us find what is consuming the most memory and some potential solutions.</description>

      <title>In-Place vs Side-by-Side SQL Upgrades; Clearing the Confusion</title>
      <description>Most of us are aware that when it comes to upgrading our SQL Servers, we have a couple different options when it comes to the methodology.  Do we perform an In-Place upgrade or a Side-by-Side?  Both options come with a myriad of pros and cons, and there's usually a "best" solution for every environment.  This session will attempt to examine exactly which scenarios lend themselves best to each technique, and we'll provide a logical way of thinking about this critical step and how to accomplish this with the least stress.</description>

      <title>GDPR - The Buck Stops Here</title>
      <description>The General Data Protection Regulations went into effect in the EU in 2014, giving the rest of the world till May 2018 to become compliant. Comprehending the intricate facets of this complex law of EU personal data, what it covers and the demands to change how many of us have managed our data is the center of this talk. Encryption and masking is only a very small part of the DBA and developer's role in being compliant and saving the business from huge fines that could make or break a company.</description>

      <title>Using Dbatools To Automate Database Migrations</title>
      <description>Migrations can be time consuming and painful. They must be completed with zero down time, and you need to remember databases, logins, agent jobs, linked servers, oh and those random credentials that no one has the password for anymore. If you have faced this situation or are facing migrating from  2008 to 2017 Instances this process can be made easier by using the PowerShell module Dbatools. This session will overview how to get Dbatools, overview of the cmdlets, and demonstrations of migrating from a 2008 instance to 2017. Basic knowledge of PowerShell is encouraged, but not required for this session.</description>
