      <description>I have been working with Microsoft Database technologies since 1994, in Design, Data Modeling, Development and Administration.  18 years of that time have been with SQL Server, going all the way back to 6.5.   

I find that I am most passionate about the Admin and HA/DR side, but will still dive into design when called upon.   

The Azure cloud is exciting and I believe is the future of SQL Server.   I love teaching new and accidental DBAs all of the things I didn't know when I started.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure for the DBA: An Introduction</title>
      <description>It doesn’t matter if you are a Junior DBA, an accidental DBA or all the way up to a Senior DBA, the infrastructure your SQL Server environment runs on is important.  Many among the DBA community came in as developers or perhaps directly into database administration roles it is equally possible that you have been out of the operations world long enough to have fallen out of the loop with what is happening.  This session is intended to provide a full stack infrastructure overview so that you can talk shop with your cohorts in operations to resolve issues and maybe even be proactive.  We will discuss, in an introductory fashion, hardware, network, storage, virtualization and operating system layers.  Additionally, some suggestions as to where to find more information will be provided.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Studio - The Open-Source, Cross-Platform, Cloud Database Tool for SQL</title>
      <description>Azure Data Studio (formerly SQL Operations Studio) is the modern, cross-platform database management tool for SQL Server, both on-premise and in the cloud.  A simple, clean approach to a UI creates an experience different from other SQL management tools today.  Fully integrated intellisense with customizable code-snippets, connection management, and dashboards, Azure Data Studio, provides the T-SQL editor experience most of us expect today.  Unlike other tools, Azure Data Studio is 100% open-source, easily extensible, and has full integration to modern source control solutions like GIT.
In this session, we introduce Azure Data Studio and interacting with SQL Server environments.  We will focus on productivity comparable to SSMS, shortcuts and time savers, as well as how to leverage source control.  Lastly, we will cover extending Azure Data Studio by setting up a development environment, and walking through the process of build and debugging a custom dashboard component, using Electron</description>

      <title>Help Me SSIS Logging, You're My Only Hope!</title>
      <description>When something goes wrong with your SSIS package and you need to tell your boss more than "I have a bad feeling about this…", let the Force of SSIS logging save you from the dark side!

SSIS logging may be the last thing on your mind when starting a new project, but getting it right in the beginning is well worth your while.  Logging can help troubleshoot errors, tackle inefficiencies, and even raise a red flag when there are issues in your data flow.  Newer versions of SQL Server have brought new options for logging.  Learn what information is available for each option along with how to implement custom logging when the built-in options aren't robust enough for your project's needs.</description>

      <description>Has your manager come to you and said "I expect the SQL Server machines to have zero downtime?" Have you been told to make your environment "Always On" without any guidance (or budget) as to how to do that or what that means? This session will walk you through the high availability options in on-premises SQL Server, the high availability options in Azure SQL Database, and how those can be combined to enable you to achieve the ambitious goals of your management. Beyond the academic knowledge, we'll discuss real world case studies covering exactly how your on-premises environments and Azure services can work together to keep your phone quiet at night.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Apache Spark</title>
      <description>As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data.  Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes.  As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk.  Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data.  In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark.  We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues like calculating PageRank.</description>

      <title>How to perform a health check</title>
      <description>Are you uncertain about the health and capacity of your SQL Server? Are you taking over a new server and need to get a better understanding of the health of the server? Are you uncertain if your servers are following industry best practices?

In this session we will start by discussing the importance of performing a Health Check. We will then show how to run the popular Blitz script by Brent Ozar. After that we will review the other key areas to check like the VM configuration, Windows Configuration, SQL Configuration, Security configuration, and Database configuration. Finally, we’ll show how to save the results for capacity and trending analysis

At the end of the session you will be able to: (1) Perform a Health Check on a server; (2) List the key areas for improvement; (3) Save the results for capacity and trending analysis.</description>

      <title>Building the HASSP: Putting SQL Server In Space</title>
      <description>In today's world, technology is a pervasive part of our lives. We have "smart" appliances everywhere: from cars, thermostats, and even refrigerators contain built-in systems to collect, store, and transmit data. Small embedded devices can also be used for scientific purposes as well, offering new and exciting ways to collect data for studies or projects at home.

The High-Altitude SQL Server Project, or HASSP, is one such project.

The HASSP team has created a high-altitude balloon that uses sensors to collect various data points and store the results in an embedded version of SQL Server!

In this session, you'll hear about how this is possible: we'll discuss the hardware used, the custom device that we built, and the software used to make it all work together. Best of all, you'll see how to recreate (and hopefully improve!) the project on your own.</description>

      <title>AzureVM + Log Shipping + Automation = Bargain Basement DR Solution (How To)</title>
      <description>Operating on a budget can result in some creative solutions. Recently I've come up with a creative solution for traditional on-premise client-server solutions that allows for full redundancy in the cloud, but at a budget price. This is accomplished through VMs, copying of logs to Blob Storage, automation of hydration, updates  de-allocation.  It may be a bit of a Rube Goldberg machine, but it works! The result is an extremely pro-rated and affordable DR solution that is within 1 hour or less of production in restorability. Come to this session to learn more about the hurdles faced when putting this solution together and to brainstorm together how it can even be improved.</description>

      <title>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance</title>
      <description>Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code. We'll also introduce a new way to graphically see actual index structure using a new "Black Arts" stored procedure called "sp_IndexDNA" that you have to see to believe.</description>

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file  log file backups a whole lot more happy and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</title>
      <description>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

After briefly discussing what CosmosDB is, we’ll take some time to discuss why you might use CosmosDB instead of SQL Server or another platform, and finally touch on some basics to get you started with CosmosDB.  Upon completion of this session you will be better equipped to discuss the value of CosmosDB to your organization.</description>

      <title>Python in SQL Server 2017</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!</description>

      <title>SQL Server Database Security: Do Your Part, Be Security Smart!</title>
      <description>With data being stolen nearly daily from even the most prestigious companies, data security should be at the forefront of all keepers of database servers and server instances. How can your SQL Server data get in the wrong hands? What are some common SQL Server specific security considerations? What are the best practices?  When and where should they be implemented?  What techniques for security can be used in SQL Server? What can I do as a DBA or Developer to ensure data is secured in all environments?  Tips and troubleshooting with real world DevOps experience will be presented to attendees to identify the most common but hardest to resolve issues.  Some topics to be discussed will be Data Masking, Security Groups, Named Instance security, and Linked Servers.</description>

      <title>Who's Pissing in Your Data Lake?</title>
      <description>The new data terms of Data Lake, Data Reservoir, and Data Swamp have left me with more questions than answers. In this presentation, Karen discusses the types of data anomalies that organizations can run into when they use external data, the wrong datasets for the right reasons and the right datasets for the wrong reasons.  

These errors in design, oversights and old school, traditional practices can impact the success of your projects, even if you don't use any data lakes.

We'll look at end-to-end processes, data capture issues, impractical designs, balancing performance against data quality.  I'll be using examples from my own personal data to show you just how my data has been mistreated in IT systems.  Plus we'll talk about your data and your data stories.

We will build a list of good practices and tools to use to spare you from a flood of data issues in your organization.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Data Compression</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.</description>

      <title>Your SQL Servers are misconfigured</title>
      <description>Your SQL Servers are misconfigured!

And it is probably not your fault. 

90% of the SQL Servers I have seen in my 18 year career are just wrong.   Not “crash” or “won’t start” wrong.  More like “why is the website so slow” wrong.

We are going to roll through a clean install and look at some things that can be made right during the install. And then we will look at some configurations that can only be done after the install.

Things like:

Instant File Initialization
Backup Compression
MAXDOP
TempDB configuration
Cost Threshold for Parallelism
And more if we have time!

Fair warning…I’m going to overuse the phrase “It Depends”

Dallas DBAs is dedicated to helping you find these issues, test them, remediate them and get the most stability, reliability and performance out of your SQL Server.</description>

      <title>PowerShell for the DBA</title>
      <description>PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.</description>

      <title>Get Near Realtime ETL with Service Broker</title>
      <description>Most of the time you’ll see ETL being done with a tool such as SSIS, but what if you need near-realtime reporting? You need to get the updates in your OLTP database to the Data Warehouse quickly, but with minimal impact on your application. This session will demonstrate how to keep your data warehouse updated in near real-time using Service Broker messages from your OLTP database.</description>

      <title>Migrate Your Database with Distributed AGs</title>
      <description>You find yourself needing to migrate to new hardware or new operating system. If you're running SQL Server 2016+, you're in luck! Distributed Availability Groups (AGs) may just be the solution you want.

In this session I will explain the purpose and usages of Distributed AGs, create a Distributed AG and the associated AGs, and perform a mock data center migration.

NOTE: This session expects that attendees are already familiar with Availability Groups.</description>

      <title>Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables</title>
      <description>Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.</description>

      <title>The Curious Case of the Foreign Key</title>
      <description>Foreign keys are basic constraints used widely in database design. This session will show how they can improve performance when used correctly. There are, however, some options that developers need to use with care because they can degrade performance significantly... and sneakily!</description>
