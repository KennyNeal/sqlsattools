      <description>Greg Moore is a graduate of RPI. There, he majored in CompSci, but probably spent as much time hiking, canoeing, caving and rock-climbing as he did studying.
He started working with SQL Server 4.21a in 1995 and has survived numerous upgrades.
He's been a Director and later VP of IT at several startups including PowerOne Media, TownNews and Traffiq and now consults. These days, when he's not busy with playing with SQL Server or spending time with his family, he can often be found underground caving or teaching cave rescue with the NCRC.
While his focus is on the operations side of DBA, his interests include DR, performance and general IT problem solving.
He is the author of: IT Disaster Response: Lessons Learned in the Field.</description>

      <title>Keeping up with SSMS</title>
      <description>Starting with SQL Server 2016, SSMS became a stand-alone product.  Updates are sent out a lot more frequently than in the past and it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with all of the changes and new features.  There were 7 new version releases in 2017 and 8 new version releases in 2018.  With all of the new releases, are you using SQL Server Management Studio to its fullest?  We will discuss some of the features available in the SSMS v17 and v18.

On top of the new versions, there is a lot of cool stuff available in SSMS that you may not be aware is there.  We will discuss and demonstrate some features offered in SSMS that will help make Developers and Database Administrators more productive (and everyone wants to be more productive).  Whether a DBA or a Developer, you will take away knowledge about the new SSMS versions along with some useful SSMS tips/tricks to use in SSMS that you can apply in your day to day activities.</description>

      <title>The next generation of Business Intelligence is done with DevOps</title>
      <description>The next generation of Business Intelligence practices is about improving effectiveness and accuracy. The simplest, most efficient way to do that is through DevOps.  DevOps for BI is no longer just getting your schemas into version control.  DevOps can bring the entire agile lifecycle to the BI world.  Agile development and continuous integration will improve the customer experience.  Advancements gained from using DevOps in BI are improved accuracy, consistency, and faster delivery.  DevOps for BI is a methodology of development, testing, QA, and Implementation that will increase the success of your projects and enhancements. This session explains with real-world examples the issues and solutions we have seen that will convince you to adopt this methodology.  We will walk through the steps to expand on what you do now and the efficiencies you will gain by starting or expanding your use of DevOps in your BI environment.</description>

      <title>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.</title>
      <description>Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this second of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn of several incredibly easy modifications to your Index Maintenance routines to actually prevent fragmentation for weeks rather than perpetuating it,  virtually eliminate “Bad” page splits, reduce wasted memory, make your log file  log file backups a whole lot more happy and increase the overall performance of even perfect code.

We’ll also learn that no simple method is a panacea, what to do about the horror of "expAnsive" updates, and how to make even GUID-keyed indexes work well.</description>

      <title>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance</title>
      <description>Most people don’t realize it but the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory, costly and continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance.

This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this first of two back-to-back sessions on the subject, we’ll explore what happens to an index in the first year of its life for four different common Fill Factors along with how “Best Practice” methods executed once per week and once per day have their way with you, your indexes, your log files, wasted memory, and the performance of your code even if it’s perfect code.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the R Programming Language for BI Professionals</title>
      <description>The modern BI professional is taking on the challenge of operationalizing data science. Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.</description>

      <title>Indexing Like a Rocket Scientist</title>
      <description>Performance is what your users care about, and indexes can both improve and decrease
performance. As a SQL Developer, do you understand the difference between a clustered and
non-clustered index or what a covering index is? What is different between OLTP and data
warehouse databases when it comes to indexing?
This session is a deep dive into
 Clustered indexes
 Non-clustered indexes
 B-Tree traversal
 Primary Keys
 Covering indexes

This session will feature live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using
statistics and query plans. Understand indexing like a rocket scientist by attending this session!

Some knowledge of T-SQL and Management Studio is recommended.</description>

      <title>Say Anything: Using knowledge base, NLP and AI to enable customer</title>
      <description>Today companies have an abundance of unstructured data. It exists in emails, text files and documents. It is not easily searchable and usable without a lot of prep work. But this data contains valuable information! 
Companies can use this new information in many different ways, for example to enable customers for a self-service support. Customers might be looking for the same answer, but they will likely ask their questions in different ways. Customers really want to be able to ... say anything.
Come and learn how to use Azure technologies to build a Chat Bot to answer questions based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or product manuals.</description>

      <description>Microsoft’s Power BI is the new hotness. In this session, you will get your hands dirty and dive into PowerBI and create an actual report, with actual data. You will get to learn from examples from what a DBA has done to implement Power BI in his shop and make his data accessible.

As a DBA, we often need to collect and display data in a friendly and interactive fashion. We will play with some PowerShell to collect data from several systems, store this data in an Azure DB in the Cloud, then point Power BI at this data to display and interact with said data. You will learn a little about PowerShell, Azure SQL DB, Power BI, and how to make these work for you.</description>

      <title>Building Composable Query Abstractions in TSQL</title>
      <description>A common critique of SQL is that it can be hard to write queries with reusable parts, something which is trivial in many programming languages. For example, even something simple, like running a query with different set of selections can be tricky to express. 

This presentation will show how this problem can be avoided by taking a data-first approach and using some advanced TSQL constructs. Along the way, we will also go over how to do GraphQL-like queries in TSQL.</description>

      <title>The very Model of a Modern Day Database</title>
      <description>Gilbert and Sullivan never had to create a database. But you do. This session will delve into details of the system databases.
These are created when the system is installed and then DBAs pretty much forget about them.  If you ask, they might have an idea of what their use is, but the truth is, they're sort of a black box to many.

This session will cover how and when to back them up, how to move them if necessary and how to take advantage of that "model" database that seems to just sort of sit there.</description>
