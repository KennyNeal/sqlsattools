      <title>Make Your Maintenance Plans Better and Faster</title>
      <description>Maintenance plans are never easy. They get worse as the databases get bigger and the maintenance windows shrink upon pressure from the customers. So, stop struggling with your nightly/weekly database maintenance plans. 
I am going share a case study of a three-terabyte database and how I tweaked my Indexing, backup and restore jobs to help cut down my maintenance window from over eight hours to under 30 minutes. By the end of my session you will be able to shrink the duration of your maintenance plans by as much as 75%. 
You will learn to use parameters like BLOCKSIZE, BUFFERCOUNT and MAXTRANSFERSIZE appropriately with the BACKUP command. You will also see the advantages of native database compression, striped, parallel and staggered backups in combination with a mix of Full/Differential and Log backups.
I will also show you how third party tools like Copy Data Virtualization or Snapshot Mirroring help us cut down our backup and restore times by as much as 95%.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Data Science with Python for Data Professional</title>
      <description>Data Science is currently the hottest topic among data analysts and technologists, but getting started can sometimes be daunting or confusing to many data professionals.  We aim to change that with this full-day, hands-on course in which you will be introduced to data science and its basic methodologies using the Python programming language!

Together we will work through some real-world data analyses using several of the most popular Python libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.  We'll cover collecting and importing data, and introduce basic statistics around our data.  We'll then move on to create some simple visualizations of our data to help us identify trends and patterns.

Note that as this is a hands-on pre-con, participants will be required to bring a laptop with a working Python installation.  Full details on this will be provided prior to the session.

      <title>BI Infrastructure in Azure: Points to Consider</title>
      <description>Success of a good BI infrastructure is measured by two most important factors: 
a) Better access to data and 
b) Increased operational efficiency
How can you set up your own BI infrastructure in the cloud to address these? 
What components do we consider?
We can do that by proper selection of technology and vendors from Azure Market Place. How do we keep an eye on possible use of Big Data for your BI. We will also look at the best practices for doing so. We will take a fleeting look at some of the storage options for us in Azure and some Big Data concepts as well.
We will learn about Copy Data Virtualization in Azure Market Place that can help you provision terabytes worth of information in matter of minutes. 
We will also learn about setting up teams and ways to train them(and yourself) in this fast evolving world of Azure.</description>

      <title>High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS</title>
      <description>The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

Cloud  Datacenter MVP David Bermingham takes explains all this and more in the session.</description>

      <title>Python in SQL Server 2017</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2017 has finally arrived, bringing with it a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!</description>

      <title>Self-Service ETL with Power Query</title>
      <description>Before any significant data analysis can take place the data often needs to be transformed, aggregated, and combined. This is often referred to as the ETL (Extraction, Transform, and Load) process. Power Query is an excellent tool in the Microsoft self-service BI stack that allows business users to discover, combine, and refine data before loading it into a Power Pivot model for further analysis. In addition, Microsoft has made connecting to a wide variety of sources including relational, structured, and semi structured data a consistent intuitive experience. This session guides you through using Power Query to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into a Power Pivot model. In addition, we will look at the M language created by the tool and look at some advanced queries you can create using M.</description>

      <title>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</title>
      <description>Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.
3 – Partitioned views for performance.
4 – Table and Index partitions.
5 – Row Data Compression.
6 – Page Data Compression.
7 – Programming a sliding window.
8 – What is different in Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>Data Profiling or Statistics 201</title>
      <description>Any new database design, normalization process or just simple research starts from data profiling. At first you determine number of rows in the data set. After that you run multiple similar queries against each column to determine Max and Min values, maximum length for text columns, number of nulls, distribution of data, and more.
When all these queries are already pre-set or dynamic or you are doing profiling via SQL Server Data Tools, it is not a problem on relatively small data set, but what if your table contains billions of records, and stretches for multiple gigabytes? All queries against that large data set will do a full table scan, which will produce very heavy I/O, and take forever.
In order to make the process faster, we will use a hidden gem of SQL Server:  Statistics. Only one table scan will be needed to generate them, and then we can use the science behind them to do research over our data.</description>

      <title>Entrepreneurship - Are you ready to make it on your own?</title>
      <description>There's no doubt about it, being an entrepreneur can be very rewarding. However, it is far from easy. So, before you embark on that journey, you have to ask yourself if this is the right thing for you to do. But, how do you know?

Attend this inspiring session by Prof Joe Wehr of the MCCC and discover the good and the bad of becoming an entrepreneur. 

This includes the things everyone needs to know, like
- how to strategize and create a business plan
- how to secure financing
- what to look out for before hiring (hiring mistakes are very costly)

And the less obvious, including
- knowing when and how to get out (retirement, anybody?)
- the not so subtle difference between a consultant and an entrepreneur (this is an eye-opener)
- how to legally extend the reach of your cash (ever heard of multitasking your money?)

If you have been thinking about “it” but aren't sure if you're ready, you need to attend this session. You might be surprised by what you learn about yourself</description>

      <title>Staging data for Azure SQL services</title>
      <description>Most companies are faced with the ever-growing big data problem.  There have been two schools of thought on how to solve this problem.

Schema on write is represented by the traditional relational database table. Only a small portion of the total data owned by the company resides in the database.

Schema on read is represented by technologies such as Hadoop or PolyBase. All data owned by the company can reside in simple storage.

Today, we will learn how to stage data using Azure blob storage which can be ingested by both techniques.

1 – Grab some big data.
2 – Create blob storage account.
3 – Copy data to container.
4 – Azure SQL database plumbing.
5 – Loading data with BULK INSERT.
6 – Azure SQL data warehouse plumbing.
7 – Loading data with POLYBASE.
8 – Azure automation with RUNBOOKS.</description>

Most BI developers are very strong in TSQL but their exposer to advanced statistics and visualizations were limited by what is available in the TSQL language. The R programming language allows us to clean, visualize, and apply advanced statistical methods to data. 

In this session I will demonstrate how to use R Studio to generate and test R scripts; generate R visuals in PowerBI; call R code in machine learning workflows; and execute R code in SQL Server. Additionally, I will cover these R programming fundamentals: creating and assigning variables; performing simple calculations; understanding R data types; vectors; matrices; factors; lists; data frames; and ggplot2 graphics.</description>

      <title>Build a White/Blacklist Bouncer. Who Gets into Your SQL Club?</title>
      <description>Are too many systems hitting your SQL Servers? Do you know who they all are? Are you under attack?
When it comes to this type of problem the consensus is to get with your network and domain admins to adequately configure access options. 
What happens when you can't wait or don't even have folks in that role to get the configuration right? 

A blacklist is a list of what cannot access something you are trying to protect. (Like the TSA no-fly list. If you are on the list, you are not getting anywhere fast.)

A whitelist is just the opposite. It is a list of what is permitted to access something. If whatever is attempting access is not on the list, it isn’t getting in.
In this session, we will go through the process to create and test your own SQL based whitelists and blacklists and also take a look at how whitelisting is being used in SQL 2017 to control what CLR objects can be trusted to run in your environment.</description>

      <description>In the modern world of information technology, SQL Server DBA tasks exceed typical Administration and T-SQL development. Each new SQL Server version brings additional technologies that help streamline and improve its functionalities. Within the last decade, SQL Server has evolved into a sophisticated Enterprise RDBMS tool, and it continues to grow by providing more functionalities to store and manipulate data reliably.

PowerShell, .NET, XML and JSON skills often appear in SQL Server DBA job requirements because the ability to work with those allow the DBA to adapt faster and more efficiently when solving different types of problems. This session designed to bring you up to speed with several of these technologies.

      <description>SSIS can be frustrating even for experienced users. There are a multitude of choices that appear to do the same thing and options that should be there aren’t.  This class focuses on techniques for getting useful work done.  The goal is to help you make better choices as a developer by exploring the multiple ways the same tasks can be accomplished within SSIS and in contrast to TSQL.  This is a practical class for getting things done by using SSIS for what it is good at doing. If you already use and or love SSIS you still might pick up a few tips or learn another structured approach. Come, let’s find a way to make SSIS useful for you, after all, you already paid for it if you own SQL server.</description>

      <title>Advanced Indexing for Accidental DBAs</title>
      <description>Somehow you managed to get yourself voluntold to take care of the company’s SQL Server installation. Over time, you picked up the basic knowledge of how to use indexes to make queries perform better. 
But there are still cases where things just don’t appear to work as expected. Cases where SQL Server seems to ignore existing indexes. Situations where you just can’t figure out how to create a fitting index in the first place.
If that describes you, this session is for you. In it you’ll discover:
- What index selectivity is and how it impacts index selection
- The ominous “tipping point” and how it can lead to surprising index choices by the optimizer
- How to improve Aggregate Performance with indexes
- How to improve Join Performance with indexes
- Indexes on heaps and the Forwarded Records trap
- Filtered Indexes
After attending, you’ll have a set of new tools and techniques in your SQL Server toolbox that you can take home and use to increase performance in your database right away.</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of Select</title>
      <description>TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Query Processing</title>
      <description>SQL Server has evolved many times over the years. SQL Server 2019 introduces "Intelligent Query Processing", greatly enhancing the "Adaptive Query Processing" which was introduced in SQL Server 2017. 
 
Intelligent Query Processing allows your queries to operate more efficiently (resulting in better query performance) - without needing to make changes to the code or the application.

In this session we will explore all of the Intelligent Query Processing features in SQL Server 2019. 

Time permitting, we will go into other changes in recent versions of SQL Server (such as execution plan changes and new Dynamic Management Objects) that will help improve your efficiency at troubleshooting and tuning SQL Server. 
 
Coming away from this session, you will have plenty of reasons to want to upgrade to SQL Server 2019 immediately!</description>

      <title>Networking 101: Getting Ready for a SQL Event</title>
      <description>Looking to get the most out of your SQL Saturday, PASS Summit, or local user group meeting? Plan ahead!  Events aren't just about learning new things, they're about meeting new people, networking with peers, and learning different approaches to common issues.

In this session, we'll go over steps you can take before, during and after the event to maximize the amount of great stuff you'll take away at the end (besides cool vendor swag).  Not just keeping up on new technologies, but meeting new people, getting leads on solutions/opportunities, and an appreciation for the community you're in and what it has to offer.</description>

      <title>SSMS Tips and Tricks</title>
      <description>Almost everyone uses SSMS to write queries and to browse around on the server - but do you use all of the features that SSMS offers to increase your productivity? Most people use few of these, and probably don't even know that many of these features even exist. Come to this session, consisting almost entirely of demos in SSMS, to see features built in to SSMS that will improve your experience and productivity. Time permitting; we'll also go into some 3rd party products that also increase your productivity in SSMS.</description>

      <title>Why Clustering for SQL Server High Availability?</title>
      <description>When it comes to SQL Server high availability (HA), SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) has been the standard since 1998 with the release of SQL Server 7. Dave Bermingham, Microsoft Cloud, and Datacenter MVP and former Cluster MVP, reviews what clusters are, why you should use them for high availability, discusses SQL Server FCI concepts and why it is an important part of your Mission Critical SQL Server deployment whether you run on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid cloud configuration.</description>

      <title>Building your First SQL Server Container Lab in Docker</title>
      <description>It wasn’t that long ago when virtualization changed the way we work with SQL and infrastructure. Now it’s all about containers. Containers can make the DBA’s job of creating and deploying servers much easier, freeing them up for other tasks such as performance tuning and security. In this session, we will go over the concepts of containers and their general capabilities. Then we will build, connect and configure a SQL Server in a container for use as a private lab.</description>

      <title>SQL Graph</title>
      <description>Graphs are everywhere!  Microsoft has added a lot of new features to SQL Server 2017 (and 2019), and among them SQL Graph has been one - one that holds a lot of promises, though it's still in its early stages (at least with Microsoft's offering).  Microsoft added SQL Graph features to their 2017 release, and has added support for MERGE (UPSERT) scenarios to ease insertions into edge tables, and Edge Constraints to apply restrictions on relationships between nodes in 2019 release (in CTP 2.0).  In this session, we'll take a look at what this feature brings to the table, and how it compares with other Graph databases.</description>

      <title>What is DevOps and Why Should DBAs Care?</title>
      <description>You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? 
Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better.</description>
