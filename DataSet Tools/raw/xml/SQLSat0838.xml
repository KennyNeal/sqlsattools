      <title>Revenge: The SQL!</title>
      <description>Pop quiz DBA: Your developers are running rampant in production. Logic, reason, and threats have all failed. You're on the edge. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?
Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</description>

      <title>Smart Alerts in SQL DB using Automation and Logic Apps</title>
      <description>If you've played with Azure SQL DB, you'll know that there is no SQL Agent provided with the service.

Fortunately there's options available to get over this hurdle such as Azure Automation which can be used as a scheduling engine to run PowerShell or Python scripts to perform your tasks. However, Azure Automation Runbooks can also be triggered from Azure SQL DB alerts.

This session will introduce Azure Automation, from a basic manually executed Runbook to an alert-driven responsive utility that can save you considerable effort.

We'll then take our Alert responses a step further and use them to trigger an Azure Logic App workflow. Azure Logic Apps provide a robust workspace with built-in scalability and retry logic for your workflow along with many connectors which can expand the response to your alert.

Imagine capturing an Alert, performing remedial action, logging the issue  response in your ticketing system and switching on the kettle for a cuppa while Azure does all the work.</description>

      <title>5 Critical Considerations When Moving to the Cloud</title>
      <description>Migrating an existing on-premises SQL Server application to the cloud can be a daunting task that consists of many complicated steps. In this webinar, our focus is on what is perhaps the MOST important steps of the process – those that lead up to the actual move to the cloud. 
The session takes you on a dive deep into the most critical considerations for moving your data and databases into the cloud, whether you use Microsoft Azure, Amazon, or another cloud provider.
We will cover:
•	The importance of cleansing your data before a major migration
•	Fully documenting your data sources and metadata
•	Choosing from many different tools and techniques to move the actual data
•	How to test data for fidelity
•	Forecasting how much migration will cost
•	How to maintain parallel systems during transitional phases
You also see demos and overviews of native features within SQL Server that enable you to move data, as well as show powerful tools from the SentryOne product set that can make</description>

      <title>Introduction to SQL Server Managed Instances</title>
      <description>Azure Managed Instances are one of the newest SQL Server related PAAS offering from Microsoft (Azure SQL Managed Instance GA in September 2018). It can be considered a hybrid of Azure SQL Database and on-premises SQL Server with all the great benefits of Platform as a Service.

In this session we will explore:

What exactly are Azure Managed Instances
The differences between Azure SQL Database, Managed Instances, and SQL Server on an Azure VM
What's good and what could be improved.

We'll investigate:
1. When to consider this option
2. How to "lift and shift" our "production" instances.
3.What Service level to consider and the possible costs.

We will also discuss some of the future directions, in particular the new Hyperscale service tier</description>

      <title>Test Driven Development in SQL Server – how to deploy code safer</title>
      <description>Test Driven Development (TDD)  is a design approach which has enabled application developers to write cleaner code. 
It is relevant for database development as it ensures that code produced using TDD and unit tests will be of higher quality which means interactions with data will be safer. 
TDD is not a new method of unit testing, it is an essential design practice for improving the quality of your deployed code.
In this session it will be shown how we can use TDD to design and write better unit tests using open-source frameworks and industry standard tools. These tools can be run within SQL Server Management Studio which means DBAs can also take advantage of TDD and unit test, to ensure more reliable code is deployed to databases. 
TDD can result in code that can be deployed more reliably and faster when using DevOps processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. 
A comprehensive DEMO will reveal how Test Driven Development can help you deploy database code safer.</description>

      <title>Performance Baselining and Alerting</title>
      <description>Ensuring peak performance on an instance of Microsoft SQL Server is not easy and requires a lot of work on the part of the DBA. Experienced DBAs know that to maintain the best possible performance, you need to make sure you are monitoring the right performance metrics on a regular basis. Using those metrics, you can determine what normal performance looks like under most workloads. After all, when troubleshooting, how can you tell what is abnormal performance if you don’t know what is normal? But how do you know what performance information to track and how to interpret it? Baseline comparisons can help.

This session describes techniques and procedures to monitor important performance metrics you can use to define as a baseline for “normal” performance. From there, we will show you how to use these baseline metrics to identify and alert on abnormal circumstances. The session includes detailed demos of how to use the native Microsoft tools, plus open-source tools, to run baseline and b</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap between SSRS and Power BI</title>
      <description>Traditionally, SSRS is used for paginated reports which gives flexibility like drill through reports, subscriptions and print formatting. With Power BI the reports are now more interactive and dynamic. There are still few gaps between these two platforms which are built to purpose. This gap is getting smaller as features are ported between these two platforms. In this session I will be going through various features which are bridging these gaps and point out the differences. These are significant and can affect your decision in choosing the right platform which will fit your needs.</description>

      <title>Looking at the Cosmos(DB)</title>
      <description>Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s Globally Distributed, Multi-Model database service.  Transparently scaling across multiple Azure regions, Cosmos DB provides for many API’s including MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin and SQL. It offers multiple consistency models and guarantees uptime or 5 9’s.

In this session we’ll take a look at this technology and learn how it might be useful – either now or in the future.</description>

      <title>Always Encrypted in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Always Encrypted was added to SQL Server 2016 and is being enhanced in SQL Server 2019 to easily allow developers and DBAs to protect their data with strong encryption. Come learn how to design and implement Always Encrypted, including a discussion of the requirements, capabilities, and limitations for your environment. We will discuss the places where this encryption mechanism makes sense while showing the ease with which this can be added to an application while providing the potential architectural issues you may encounter.</description>

      <title>Understanding Big Data Clusters</title>
      <description>Starting with SQL Server 2019 preview, SQL Server Big Data Clusters allow you to deploy scalable clusters of SQL Server, Spark, and HDFS containers running on Kubernetes. These components are running side by side to enable you to read, write, and process big data from Transact-SQL or Spark, allowing you to easily combine and analyze your high-value relational data with high-volume big data.
In this session we will explore the technology and business/use cases for using SQL Server Big Data Clusters within your organisation. Welcome to the future of SQL Server.</description>
