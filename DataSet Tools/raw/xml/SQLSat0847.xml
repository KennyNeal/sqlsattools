      <description>While the Azure platform provides built-in safety mechanisms, these are not always well understood. Further, a good architect will ensure redundancy even within an already protected system. This session will show how the Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings such as Azure SQL Database, Azure MySQL and Azure Managed Instance, are built and maintained by Microsoft to provide protection for your vital information. We’ll also go over methods you can employ to add additional protection to your systems. Moving to the cloud and taking advantage of all that it offers doesn’t mean your data is automatically, fully protected. The knowledge from this session will help to ensure a higher degree of safety, faster recovery, and more up-time for your databases on the Azure Data Platform.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB</title>
      <description>This session presents an overview of Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, massively scalable, low (single-digit millisecond) latency, fully managed NoSQL database service that is designed specifically for modern web and mobile applications. Like other NoSQL platforms, Cosmos DB supports a schema-free data model, built-in partitioning for sustained heavy-write ingestion, and replication for high availability. But only Cosmos DB offers turnkey global distribution, automatic indexing, and SLAs for guarantees on 99.99% availability, throughput, latency, and consistency.

We tour many features of Cosmos DB, including its multi-model capabilities which allow you to store and query schema-free JSON, graph, key/value, and columnar data models. You’ll learn about global distribution, scale-out partitioning, tunable consistency, custom indexing, and more. We’ll also explore client development using the many available SDKs and APIs. Attend this session, and get up to speed on Cosmos DB toda</description>

      <title>Imposter Syndrome   How to work through it</title>
      <description>At one point or another most of us have had that feeling. You feel like you are about to be fired at any moment, like it is only a matter of time until they find out you don't know what you are doing and you are out of your depth. Or maybe you are sitting in a meeting with a group of your peers discussing the project you are working on. You see what you believe to be a large flaw in the current project, yet you do not speak up as you feel like you and not qualified enough to voice your concern. When your coworkers or boss pay you a compliment and try to express how impressed they are with you work or value as an employee do you try to diminish the complement or your value? If you have ever been in one of the situations above you have probably had a case of Imposter Syndrome. In this session we will discuss what Imposter Syndrome is, how it affects people and most importantly how to identify it in yourself and others and some techniques to help you break out of these feelings.</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere - Straight from the Source</title>
      <description>Over the years, virtualization has matured from the exotic black magic realm to become a mainstream standard IT practice. quot;Virtualize Firstquot; is now a well-accepted default practice in most enterprises and any deviation is now considered an anomaly. In spite of this trend, many IT administrators and architects still have some reservations about virtualizing SQL Server workloads. They consider SQL too quot;criticalquot; to be virtualized; they wonder and worry about scale about performance; they are looking for guidance and reassurance. If this is where you (or your clients) are today, be sure to attend this session. You will gain valuable insights from what others have done to successfully undertake similar tasks in their environments. We will talk about configuration pitfalls to avoid and also review the configuration and current performance data for some of the most demanding applications in customers environments.

      <title>SQL Server Internals and Architecture</title>
      <description>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?</description>

      <title>Using Azure Databricks to Develop Scalable Data Solutions</title>
      <description>Worried about performance when processing a Data Lake or other large data store?  Need to develop in a collaborative environment and visualize the results in Power BI?  Azure Databricks, one of the newer components added to Azure, allows users to connect to data sources such as Azure Data Lake, Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL DW, Cosmos DB, Azure DB, and SQL Server and stream the data using Apache Spark to process data for a machine learning [ML] solution and provide the data to Power BI for visualization.  Azure Databricks can deliver a very quick way of processing data by adding nodes to increase performance for large data analysis tasks. Azure Databricks also includes a collaborative workspace so that using Azure Active Directory, allowing teams of people to collaboratively develop code in a notebook in R or Python and implement the notebook as an Azure Databrick job. The step-by-step demos will include all you need to know to implement Databricks.</description>

      <title>Back to Basics - The SELECT Statement</title>
      <description>If you are going to do anything with data you are going to need to learn how to query data. And the language to query the majority of those systems is through SQL (Structured Query Language). The pull data from any systems you are going to be relying on the Select statement. The features in the statement may vary slightly from platform to platform, but the core capabilities are the same.

In this session, we will dive deep in to the SELECT statement as the window to getting your data. In this session, we will be using one platform, but the lessons learned here will be applicable to querying any system that supports a SQL language interface. This session will cover things like querying, joins, functions, aggregation, sub queries, and much more. This session will give you the foundation to start analyzing data in any database system.</description>

      <title>SQL Security, Encryption,  Compliance</title>
      <description>In today's regulatory environment, expertise in security and compliance are table stakes in the DBA job market.  Industries that manage customer data (finance, health care, etc.) have strict protocols required by law and enforced by audits, which are kind of like a month-long root canal but not as fun.   
In this presentation we'll cover regulatory standards, security basics and best practices, and the various encryption options available in SQL Server (Backups, TDE, Column, AlwaysEncrypted).  We'll also cover monitoring/logging, go over some new features, and some bonus material on dealing with audits.

      <title>Exploring Execution Plans</title>
      <description>Getting started reading execution plans is very straight forward. The real issue is understanding the plans as they grow in size and complexity. This session will show you how to explore the nooks and crannies of an execution plan in order to more easily find the necessary information needed to make what the plan is telling you crystal clear. The information presented here will better empower you to traverse the execution plans you’ll see on your own servers. That knowledge will make it possible to more efficiently and accurately tune and troubleshoot your queries.</description>

      <title>[StepByStep] SQL Server on Container? What is Kubernetes?</title>
      <description>Docker and Kubernetes are becomes very hot industry since last couple of years.

SQL Server used to run only on Physical machine.
Now, it's not any more strange or wrong that SQL server run on VM.

This session is designed for understanding about container and how SQL server could run on container.

There are 2 types of applications, Stateless and Stateful.
We will go over the difference between them and will deliver the detail cases how SQL server could adjust in Container environment.

Therefore, developer or DBA could choose better architecture in various conditions.

Within this session will cover what the market demand is and what SQL server can do on the demand.</description>

      <title>Don't just code it—Generate It</title>
      <description>Code Generators are all the rage—BIML, JS frameworks, .NET scaffolding, even the humble templates provide by SSMS for views, stored procedures, functions.
Table-driven applications allow one set of code to handle changing business needs. Metadata-driven code generation takes this a giant step further. If you can describe your code with an algorithm operating against a set of data, you can get a computer to produce the code.
 - Source to Target mapping documents can be used to generate the code to effect the mapping.
 - Service Broker activation stored procedures have a clearly defined structure. They can be mass-produced.
 - Standard CRUD stored procedures can be stamped out cookie-cutter fashion.
 - Business rules can be encoded in data and the code to implement them manufactured.
Generated code has systematic errors. Fix the errors at the generator. All the code now works. If the code is so boring that a computer can produce it, why not spend your talent doing something interesting?</description>

      <description>This session is designed for you, the experienced SSIS developer who's been hearing about the Business Intelligence Markup Language, Biml, but has not taken the plunge. We will cover what the Biml language is and how using your familiar development tools, SQL Server Data Tools, SSDT, and BIDS Helper, you will be able to streamline the creation of SSIS packages.

We will work through progressively more complex examples from a "Hello World" equivalent to a to a full fledged, audited, truncate and reload pattern based on an external metadata repository. 

You will leave this session armed with the knowledge of how Biml can help you achieve a consistent and reproducible approach for the creation of SSIS solutions.</description>

      <title>What just happened? Creating your own real-time dashboard with Grafana, Influx, and Telegraf</title>
      <description>Like many of you, I've been fortunate enough to work in places where the budgets were non-existent, the systems were always crashing, and what tools we did have, were good for some, not all.  For those fighting fires and wearing multiple hats, you're used to, but still scared of "hey, what just happened?"    

In this session, I'll show you how to install, configure, and build your own dashboard with Grafana, and utilize InfluxDB and Telegraf, which I believe will help you fight your fires better than before.  If you're like me, you've at times wished you had a way to easily display and create your own metrics, and after this, you'll be well on your way to do so.  You can also integrate in monitoring, alerting, and so much more, all for the low, low, price of whatever your time is worth.</description>

      <description>If you had an unlimited budget, any problem is easy to fix.  But when users complain and your boss is hovering around your desk, and you don't have Platinum bucks, what can you do to  ensure your SQL Servers are maintained and optimized properly?  In this session, we'll dive through performance monitoring and building baselines using open source scripts that give you super powers to even go back in time and diagnose problems that are no longer available.  

Do you have processes that block or deadlocks queries but are no longer running?  Do you have power users that do some questionable reports or a rogue developer with sysadmin access?  How do you resolve them if they're not using the system when you have eyes on them?

Finally, you will walk away from this session with a plan that can be implemented tomorrow and never be caught off guard again.  You will look like a superhero that can be proud of performance monitoring system that you built yourself.  Come join the fun!</description>

      <description>With the release of SQL Server 2016, Reporting Services finally got some love!  In this session, you will get an overview of some of the new features and functionality:  A look at the new Report Manager interface, Mobile reports, KPIs and the new control we have over the placement of parameters.  We will also look at the new Mobile Report Publisher app and see how easy it is to create mobile reports.  The session will cover tips for a smart migration to 2016.

The session will then dive into how to use the data in the ReportServer database tables to see which reports in your environment are being used and how well they are performing.  With this understanding you can determine which reports, data sets and data sources to migrate to a new 2016 installation.  Come see how to leverage PowerShell to extract the reports from the database, instead of having to download them from Report Manager, to facilitate an easy migration to a new SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services implementation.</description>

      <title>Better Query Performance from Proper Statistics Management</title>
      <description>When the SQL Server optimizer evaluates a query to determine how best to execute it, the statistics are quite possibly the most important tool at its disposal. But SQL Server statistics objects aren’t perfect because they only contain estimated summary information. In this session, we’ll start with an overview of what the statistics objects are, how the optimizer uses them, and some general guidelines for their maintenance. Then we’ll look at some of the issues, how to find them, and how to solve them, that can arise due to their imperfection: ascending keys (the most prevalent statistics based performance killer?), skewed distribution, or downright bad summary information. There’ll be many examples, and even a stored procedure to help you find ascending keys. By applying the techniques we’ll discuss, you WILL see improved query performance.</description>

Wouldn't it be nice to standardize your SQL installations so that on every new release there wasn't much to change, but were still able to take advantage of new features?  Attend this session and we'll walk through some of the installation scripts that I have tested and built from SQL 2008 to SQL 2017. 
 
After this session, you'll learn the benefits you can do from a command line install, quickly provision SQL Servers and prepare for future releases without too much maintenance.  You'll also learn how to take advantage of updates and new features by adding a few options into your script.</description>

      <title>Mastering Master Data Services</title>
      <description>Master Data Services enables you to manage a master set of your organization's data. You can organize the data into models, create rules for updating the data, and control who updates the data. With Excel, you can share the master data set with other people in your organization. Data stewards can use Excel to help manage the data repository and ensure that your MDS data is always up-to-date and accurate.

In this presentation we will cover MDS from start to finish including installation, creating models/entities, working with data, using the Excel add-in, security, hierarchies, views, versions, and business rules. After this presentation, you will have a good understanding of what master data management is, what MDS does, how to use it, and how to get started with your own MDS project.</description>

      <description>Containers have quietly been taking over the world of infrastructure, especially amongst developers and CI/CD practitioners. However, in the database space, container adoption has been lower. SQL Server 2017 introduced the concept of deploying databases into Docker containers. In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of creating containers, learning about Kubernetes for management, and how to further your learning in this new and emerging space.</description>

      <description>This 500 level session will focus on using undocumented statements and trace flags to get insight into how the query optimizer works and show you which operations it performs during query optimization. I will use these undocumented features to explain what the query optimizer does from the moment a query is submitted to SQL Server until an execution plan is generated including operations like parsing, binding, simplification, trivial plan, and full optimization. Concepts like transformation rules, the memo structure, how the query optimizer generates possible alternative execution plans, and how the best alternative is chosen based on those costs will be explained as well.</description>

      <title>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</title>
      <description>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. In contrast, COZYROC's Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated into the SSIS package at runtime without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at runtime. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases. In t</description>

      <description>T-SQL windowing functions can simplify many complex queries. They are the best thing that has happened to the T-SQL language in years, but many database professionals and developers haven’t heard about them. 
They were initially introduced with SQL Server 2005. In 2012, Microsoft added several new functions that let you do things like pull values from different rows without a performance penalty. 
Attend this session to learn how T-SQL windowing functions apply to many real world examples.</description>
