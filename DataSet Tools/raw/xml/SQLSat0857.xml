I am working on my 3rd BI Project now. All of them are in different business areas and are using different technologies. What is common between them is the  willingness to find the most proper development methodology as it is not a canonical development team and no development methodology works "out of the box" . 
In my talk I would like to share my experience in this area.</description>

      <title>What is CI/CD for databases or how to automate DB changes</title>
      <description>In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tends to be a different and separated process of the application delivery process or even an entirely manual process. This contributes to the perspective that the database is a bottleneck in the agile process.
In this session, I will show how to build a deployment pipeline capable of delivering database and application changes. The pipeline includes the following steps: source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery. I will share methods and strategies that allow bringing together databases and applications in the delivery process reducing the delivery pain. 
The main goal is to understand that applications and databases can and should share the same deployment pipeline and that this pipeline will allow you not be afraid of making database changes.</description>

      <title>DevOPS for DBAs - Where is your magic wand?</title>
      <description>DBA is key when a database platform change occurs and necessary to support the application, release processes and there is a miracle waiting to happen!

Based on my experience DBA is left out in the key element of DEVOPS, this is unfortunate. DBAs have a lot to offer . 
In this session let us overview where exactly DBAs can make miracles with their magic wand, let's talk about process and procedures. To evaluate each change request to ensure that it is well thought out, is compliant with organizational best practices. Also review what Azure DevOps is offering to manage your cloud deployments.

Take away best practices associated in DEVOPS and DBA world.</description>

      <title>Plan Caching</title>
      <description>With a few exceptions, SQL Server stores the execution plan for a query in the internal plan cache. In most cases, subsequent execution of a similar query will greatly benefit from this mechanism, but not in all cases.
In this session, you will learn why and under what circumstances SQL Server caches execution plans.
We will analyze the plan cache to identify performance issues, such as plan pollution, and how to avoid this.
You'll see the benefits and drawbacks of parameter sniffing for procedures and functions, and the differences between native compiled and interpreted stored procedures.
Furthermore, we will analyse how the settings ‘optimize for adhoc workloads’ and ‘forced parameterization’ influence query execution and the re-use of cached plans.</description>

      <title>Hadoop in AWS - You can already use it without knowing about it</title>
      <description>This is story about we tried to do some data analysis for S3 logs, and found that AWS Athena allows to do it easy and fast using SQL queries. But for data analysis we need to have more powerful visualization tools - and Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (Hadoop as a Service) in fact are closely integrated with S3, Athena and other AWS services.  
Deployed in 2 clicks, Apache Zeppelin can query your data directly from S3 file storage and works with data using SQL or Spark (Scala) if You are brave enough. 
We used all this stuff only for one reason - delete unused packages from Artifactory, which grows up to 3 Tb and became a little bit expensive to host in Cloud. But the issue was - 'unused' definition was little bit unclear, and some deep analysis need to be made to make a proper decision. 
Golang application helps us to retrieve data from Artifactory, and Zeppelin and Spark SQL queries allowed to filter and visualize corresponding data.</description>

      <title>Hacking SQL Server</title>
      <description>You have been working with SQL Server for several years and you feel quite comfortable with most of the available features. Even you have a checklist for installation/configuration of SQL Server to be compliant with corporate standards. However, somewhere on the back of the head you have a feeling that there is something more that can be done to secure your SQL Server. If you are willing to see how small reconfiguration can lead to compromise of your SQL Server join this session. There will be demos on live system showing how to leverage misconfiguration and how to prevent them from happening in the future. After the session you will have a set of checks that can be implemented on your system.</description>

      <title>Securing, maintaining and troubleshooting your Azure SQL in production.</title>
      <description>Azure SQL usage seems to be easy and straightforward, but there are set of steps to make it truly reliable and properly secured. This talk is about following three important topics.

Are you ready for disaster, are your team take a proper drill? I`m sure you do, but in case you need a few tips and check list - you will obtain it. Usually, proper monitoring(including network impact), profiling and alerts are introduced after the first production issue, so this will be first point.

Security seems to be hot topic these days and there are few steps to secure your Elastic cluster proper way, plain Azure SQL Server firewall might be not enough. Security measures overview with best practices, vNet, user roles isolation, encryption at rest, secret maintenance with KeyVault, Security center and other tips.

Infrastructure as code is essential part of Azure and proper set of the environment crud scripts can really save your day at some point in future, also you can do useful stuff with T-SQL in</description>

      <title>The SQL Server DBA’s Guide to Docker Containers</title>
      <description>Your role as a SQL Server DBA is evolving and you are now responsible for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications – not just SQL Server databases. You don’t have a clue where and how to start. You are confused about this whole DevOps buzzword being thrown around and you are wasting a lot of time figuring things out on your own. What’s worse, you end up being a stressed, overworked engineer who wished you could focus on the “cool stuff”, but are instead stuck in firefighting mode while juggling the additional workload.

This session is specifically for you. This whole-day workshop is specifically designed for senior SQL Server database administrators and systems engineers responsible for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

Learning Objectives:
1) Introduce SQL Server DBAs to the world of Docker Containers
2) Leverage Docker Containers for deploying SQL Server
3) Introduce SQL Server DBAs to Container Or</description>

      <title>The databases in SSDT - a work with project and best practices</title>
      <description>A task seems to be easy. Maintenance a project of a database in the code repository, treat as master-version and do deployment evenly and frequently. Simple? Seemingly. The things become more complex as fast as a number of objects in database growing. While instead of one database, we have over a dozen. When databases have got the references to each other. And how about dictionary tables? Where to keep them and how to script? Additional issues are coming whilst we would like to control instance-level objects.
All these topics I will explain in the session focused on practical aspects of work with Microsoft Visual Studio Data Tools.</description>

      <title>The future of serverless computing</title>
      <description>Are you still planning your servers capacity in CPU and RAM? Do you enjoy answering questions like “what amount of servers we need to buy to serve 10K and 10M users”? Do you enjoy paying for those servers while they are sitting idle?

In my session I will talk about the current state and the future of serverless computing. I will show several demos that show how to start using serverless computing, what are the application scenarios for it, how it can scale, what it will cost, etc.

This session will be useful for developers and architects who are seeking a way to create an app utilizing all your previous skills, but make it scalable, reliable, fast and cost efficient.</description>

      <title>How to win Kaggle competition and get familiar with machine learning ?</title>
      <description>Have you heard that knowing machine learning is the easiest way to get rich quickly? Let’s test this statement. Kaggle is the place to do data science projects, why not to start there?
During this session we will solve simple Kaggle competition. Actually, we will submit two solutions. The first made with super-duper deep neural network (black-box approach). Then we will follow proven ML methodologies and solve the problem methodically. All that using SQL Server Machine Learning Services.
Minimum slides and maximum fun guaranteed.</description>

      <title>Working in Batches</title>
      <description>Early in your career you learnt that loops are bad and that you should use set-based statements. However, there are situations when trying to processing all at once takes you into problems. In this session we will learn what these situations are and how we can address them by splitting up the work in batches. We will learn techniques for batching and pitfalls to watch out for so that we don't introduce new performance issues.

We will also look at batching from a different angle: problems that requires a loop for, say, a single customer, but where we can process all customers abreast for better performance.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Polybase</title>
      <description>Polybase started as a technology which allows you to query data stored in Hadoop or Azure Blob Storage as if it were just another table within SQL Server. In SQL 'Aris' (2019), Polybase will grow further and add additional connectivity and querying potential.  

Come to this Beginner talk to learn how you can get started using Polybase in SQL Server right away, and learn about the 3 core EXTERNAL objects used in Polybase.  We will compare and contrast the differences and similarities between Polybase and Linked Servers.</description>

      <description>If you are reading Azure IoT documentation you will stumble a lot on the “SQL-like query language” or “SQL-like language” syntagms.
In this presentation we will explore Azure IoT places where queries are used and see how to use them. And in the process to find out more about this “SQL-like” languages and how being a DB developer cam make you a IoT hero.
We will concentrate on the scenarios with the greatest impact, where a little SQL can solve you a lot of hassle.
So, we will leave no SQL query unturned  in Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, Power Bi to name a few.</description>
