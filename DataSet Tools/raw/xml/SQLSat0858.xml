      <title>Working with Very Large Tables Like a Pro in SQL Server 2017</title>
      <description>A common use case in many databases is a very large table, which serves as some kind of activity log, with an ever-increasing date/time column. This table is usually partitioned, and it suffers from heavy load of reads and writes. Such a table presents a challenge in terms of maintenance and performance. Activities such as loading data into the table, querying the table, rebuilding indexes or updating statistics become quite challenging.
The latest versions of SQL Server, including 2017, offer several new features that can make all these challenges go away. In this session we will analyze a use case involving such a large table. We will examine features such as Incremental Statistics, New Cardinality Estimation, Delayed Durability and Stretch Database, and we will apply them on our challenging table and see what happens...</description>

      <title>Hash Match, the Operator - part 1</title>
      <description>SQL Server has a lot of difference execution plan operators. By far the most interesting, and the most versatile, has to be the Hash Match operator.
Hash Match is the only operator that can have either one or two inputs. It is the only operator that can either block, stream, or block partially. And it is one of just a few operators that contribute to the total memory grant of an execution plan.
If you ever looked at execution plans, you will have seen this operator. And you probably have a rough idea of what it does. But do you know EXACTLY what happens when this operator is used? In this two-hour 500-level session, we will dive deep into the bowels of the operator to learn how it performs.
It is going to be wild ride, so keep your hands, arms, and legs inside the conference room at all times; and please remain seated until the presenter has come to a full stop.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Query Optimizer end-to-end</title>
      <description>Execution plans are produced by the query optimizer that generates possible alternative execution plans for the same query through the use of the transformation rules. You already learned how to read an execution plan and the most significant things to look for such as warnings, most costly operators and table methods access. Now, you want to acquire a deeper understanding of how the Query Optimizer builds the optimal plan. In this session we will learn more about the phases of the optimization process, using undocumented trace flags we will discover the secrets of the Query Optimizer. Finally, we will show how to understand better the workload in terms of the percentage of time-out, the percentage of queries that contain sub-query and so on. At the end, Query Optimizer will not have any secret for you.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Polybase</title>
      <description>Polybase started as a technology which allows you to query data stored in Hadoop or Azure Blob Storage as if it were just another table within SQL Server. As you move your data estate from on-premises to a cloud architecture, Polybase will be at the center of your cloud strategy.  Data Integration (DI) is replacing traditional ETL for cloud architecture, and central to this strategy is the separation of storage from compute.  

Come to this Intermediate talk to learn how you can get started using Polybase in SQL Server right away and learn about the 3 core EXTERNAL objects used in Polybase.  We will compare the differences and similarities between Polybase and Linked Servers.  In SQL 'Aris' (2019), Polybase will grow further and add additional connectivity and querying potential.  We will take a first look at how Polybase is central to SQL 2019 Big Data Clusters.  Azure Kubernetes Services makes SQL Server Big Data Clusters easy to create and deploy.</description>

This is a demo-driven session, suited for DBAs, developers and security consultants. Both exploits and security recommendations to avoid them will be covered.
Disclaimer: No actual crimes will be committed. Please do not send agents to my house again.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning - Best Practices and Vulnerabilities</title>
      <description>It seems like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are a must nowdays.
For projects carrying a simple or well kown problem we can find a lot of ready-made solutions, but this extremne easy to use could be one of our best enemy when facing with specific custom problems.
With this session we will cover how to apply best practices in configurin ML but much more, do we reaaly need it always?
The second part will cover vulnerabilities of ML discovering how easy could be to fool a neural network by some techinques (Like pixel attack) and their implication in projects that requires no security issues.</description>

      <title>Design, Build, Deploy  Monitor a Store on the Cloud using Azure Services as Lego blocks</title>
      <description>A walk through on how a real-life Store has been designed, developed, deployed and monitored on Azure Cloud by exploiting Azure Services such as CosmosDB, Azure Functions, Azure Queues, Azure Application Insights, Azure Log, etc. 
Furthermore, how all these can be orchestrated and programmed on Microsoft .NET Core 3.X, how to build custom API's and put all of them in action.</description>
