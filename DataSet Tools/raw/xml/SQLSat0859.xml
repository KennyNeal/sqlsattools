      <title>Storytelling for Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics</title>
      <description>Storytelling and depiction of information has existed for hundreds of years in various forms and formats. In today’s era of artificial intelligence and machine-assisted analytics, accurately interpreting and effectively communicating findings is becoming a crucial skill to bridge the growing data literacy gap. To help decision makers get the most value from analytics projects to drive better outcomes, you need to help them make sense of the results. 

Machine learning and advanced analytics can be difficult to understand and explain. Describing the problem, the model, the relationships among variables and the findings are often subtle, surprising and technically complex. Effectively translating quantitative insights and telling a compelling story requires planning, compelling design, and visualization choices. Successful analytical communicators  use the entire process to communicate with stakeholders. Don't miss this fun demo-packed educational session.</description>

      <title>What's New in Creating Data Models and Reporting with Power BI</title>
      <description>Power BI has grown into a very useful and powerful tool to analyze your corporate data, but not everyone knows that it is a product that is literally changing monthly.  Each month Microsoft introduces new features to the downloaded and online versions of PowerBI.  Keeping up can be time consuming.  However, Microsoft provides documentation, videos, and other resources to not only help you up to date with these changes, but to also allow you to vote on potential new features and even to submit new feature ideas of your own.  If you have not been keeping up with the changes to Power BI since you first downloaded your desktop version a year or more ago, you need to attend this session to learn how to keep up with this ever changing, ever improving product.</description>

      <title>Changing Data Is Easy, Managing Data Change is Hard!</title>
      <description>Databases are growing.  The way we use data is changing and growing.  When you have a lot of change, it has to be managed, or bad things happen to your data and your job!  A common problem with database change management is... database change management.  This session walks the user through the concepts of database change management, why it's important, and how SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) makes this process easy.  There are a lot of great features in this frequently overlooked product, and if you are not using it, your job is a lot harder than it needs to be.  Some things we will discuss: schema compare, database versions in source control, renaming objects, and how your job is pushing the button to deliver it the EASY way with SSDT.</description>

      <title>“Past, Present and Future of the Data Profession"</title>
      <description>In the excitement of the possibilities that Big Data technology and Data Science techniques are opening, we forgot that correlation is not equal than causation and that any design model has intrinsic limitations. Dr. Deming said "In God we trust, all others must bring data." but what he really wanted to reach was Wisdom! Data is just the raw material the real goal is Wisdom I have been thinking about the chain toward Wisdom (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) and wonder how many organizations have reached, at least, the level of Knowledge and if any at all have reached the pinnacle of Wisdom. We are drowning in a sea of data and we are starving for wisdom. 
How is Data Science and Big Data changing our profession? What is a Data Scientist? What is a Data Engineer? What is a Data Analyst? Which skills do we need?</description>

      <title>Successfully Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere</title>
      <description>Today, many organizations have already virtualized most of their non critical applications, these organizations are now employing a "Virtual First" policy, harnessing the efficiency and cost savings of virtualization for their most critical applications. 
Still, many IT architects and DBA's are hesitant of virtualizing their SQL workloads, they are worried about  performance, scale, availability and support for what is usually considered their most critical applications.  In this session we will review the guidance for successfully virtualizing critical SQL databases, we will cover the best practices, real world customer experience  and what to watch out for when virtualizing the most critical SQL databases. The session is delivered by a member of the VMware's SQL Server Experts Group.</description>

      <title>Constraints are the Key (to Data Integrity)</title>
      <description>This session is designed to introduce you or to re-engage your interest in all the options we have for setting constraints in a database. From datatypes to nulls to checks, defaults, foreign keys, and triggers we have a LOT of options, so it's important to know the options and also have a bit of a professional philosophy on when to use each of them - we will do a brief look at each of them. We'll talk about why getting them right on day 1 is so important, how to add them to existing tables (the syntax is the least interesting part!), and some patterns and anti-patterns you can look for when you get to the office on Monday.  Constraints aren't glamorous, but they matter, and they require an advocate - you! A good session for DBA's, developers, and yes, even managers.</description>

      <title>Accessibility Concerns of Reporting Style with Power BI</title>
      <description>Reports are no longer just black and white columns and rows of numbers. Reports combine tables with charts, KPIs and more. There is a lot to be concerned about when designing reports to provide information to your audience. Today, your company can face lawsuits if your reports are not accessible to all users.  You must consider the way you display your data, the amount of data displayed, the use of color and maybe even the use of animation. Creating attractive reports is not just about making them pretty. It is about grabbing your audience's attention. It is making sure you don't inadvertently introduce accessibility problems that limit who can receive your message, your data. This session while looking at some reporting best practices will also give you information to steer you clear of accessibility concerns to insure access to your results by all consumers of your report.  (Note: Accessibility is governed through the guidelines of the American Disabilities Act)</description>

Too many times to count,  Tim has been brought in by organizations to help recover failed systems where administrators simply didn't know how to properly restore SQL Server backups when they have to. In this session, Tim will explain the various types of backups that can be taken and demonstrate how to restore each of them. Apart from covering the common full, differential and log backups,  Tim will also cover partial, file group, and COPY_ONLY backups, backing up to and restoring from a URL, backup encryption, and how to perform a hack attach for the ultimate tail log restore. There's something here for everyone to learn!</description>

      <title>2017 SSIS Scale Out for HA/DR ETL</title>
      <description>2016 SSIS packages can access data anywhere throughout the network, but normally run on the server they are deployed on. And if something terrible happens to that server, the manual setup of the SSISDB can be time consuming. With 2017, SSIS packages can be deployed once and run on several servers, even simultaneously. This session will teach you how to set up 2017 SSIS Scale Out packages so that your SSIS packages can now be in a Highly Available and Disaster Recovery environment.</description>

      <title>Thinking in SQL</title>
      <description>SQL is conceptually different than most programming languages. Join us for a conversation about SQL, why it's different from traditional procedural languages, and how to effectively use this truly elegant programming language. Rather than focus on the kinds of information easily located on the Web, we'll concentrate on how to use SQL for the tasks that it's really good at. Beginners will get a great introduction to the style of thought that gets the most out of SQL. Experienced developers will find a good refresher and an opportunity to share their experiences with others.</description>

      <title>Hadoop 123. NoSQL, Not Only SQL SQL Everywhere</title>
      <description>Since the end of the previous decade, our profession has been kicked by a set of new models, technologies, and architectures that are revolutionizing our practice. I pretend to clarify the position of SQL as the LINGUA FRANCA for Data and the relational model versus the allegations of deprecation of the relational model, and the NoSQL movement presentation of SQL as a language with no future. These among others are the topics of my presentation.
In this presentation, I will depict the Hadoop evolution from version1 to version 3,  and its relation to legacy architectures models and in particular to SQL.</description>

      <title>Using Powershell to Document SQL Server</title>
      <description>Most DBAs use multiple native and third party tools to fully document SQL Server instances yet still dont get all the objects. Even using Visual Studio and Database Projects, not all objects are exported because they live at the server level, above the database. Using Powershell, we will script out an organized set of files that can be checked into any Source Control system and or used for Disaster Recovery purposes. Objects exported include: SQL Agent Jobs/Alerts/Schedules, NT Service Credentials, SSIS-MSDB, SSIS-Catalog, SSAS Cubes, SSRS Reports, Logins, Server Configs, Linked Servers, DB Mail Operators/Accounts, Server Triggers and much more</description>

      <title>Tracking Change is the Backbone of Your Data Platform</title>
      <description>Features and concepts like Change Tracking, Change Data Capture, Temporal Tables, and other similar delta systems are complex and may carry a stigma or misapprehension in your organization around performance or security or cost. Even if you do not directly implement these features or methods absolutely, most information systems rely on tracking changes especially from legacy line of business applications. I'm here to show you robust techniques for implementing delta systems in SQL Server to increase the trustworthiness of your data warehouse.
