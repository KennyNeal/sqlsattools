      <title>Large Transactional Data Migration: A Sr. DBA Case Study From The Trenches</title>
      <description>No need to groan anymore when you hear the words "Data Migration"!
I'll show you the Data Migration Script that the Mid Level Developer gave me to start with, and you will be AMAZED at the transformation to the final product!  Walk thru the steps I took for the data migration and the additional database implications moving the data has.  As a Sr. DBA, my code has a special focus on performance and resource utilization throughout the development and implementation process. Participants will learn of the techniques that can make for a smooth data migration, development through testing through production deployment. In additon, some of the gotchas I uncovered as well as their resolutions will be reviewed.  I will share scripts related to table partitioning, indexing, as well as pre and post data migration scripts that partitipants will find easy to implement in their own Data Migrations.</description>

      <title>Extending DevOps To SQL Server</title>
      <description>Most organizations are under pressure to speed up the software delivery cycle, whether that’s to respond more quickly to the needs of the business, the needs of your customers or just to keep up with the competition.  Unfortunately the database is commonly considered a bottleneck.  Without the right processes in place, database change management can slow things down, adding risk, uncertainty, and getting in the way of development and operations working together to deliver.  Any organization that wants to fully benefit from a DevOps approach is going to have to overcome some specific challenges presented by the database. This session will teach you how to take DevOps principles and practices and apply them to SQL Server so that you can speed up the database delivery cycle at the same time you protect the information contained within.</description>

      <title>Let’s Build SSIS Packages with Biml – Live!</title>
      <description>Have you heard about the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml)? Maybe you’ve even seen a session about it before but you still have doubts about how easily you can make something useful out of it. In this session, we’ll use Biml to build and populate a staging area including the corresponding SSIS packages. But there won’t be any pre-compiled demos - everything is happening live! Starting with a blank staging database, we will end up building a complete solution over the course of this session to prove that you can start from scratch and still quickly be successful.
Let’s see, how that goes… :)

PS: Even if you have not heard about Biml but are still tired of manually building SSIS packages or ADF pipelines, this is the right session for you!</description>

      <title>Business  Technology: A Communication Guide</title>
      <description>Technical teams and business decision makers frequently conflict. Business people don’t always understand that without software, their companies wouldn’t make money. Developers don’t always realize that solving a problem requires more than the latest framework. Each group has different priorities. This session is designed to help technical teams reconcile those priorities. You will learn to identify the values you share with the business and how to communicate with those shared values in mind. You’ll also learn how to apply different communication styles when discussing technical solutions with the business. By finding a shared set of values and a shared language, you’ll create solutions that have business and technology working in harmony.</description>

      <title>Analysis Services is in Azure? Seriously!? Let's build a model!</title>
      <description>Have you used SSAS before? Have you created reports using T-SQL and Group by? Are you interested in or currently using Power BI? Do you you have a need for Analysis  Services but don't want to have to deal with the hassle of buying and installing a server? Are you dreading having to upgrade your hardware for your current SSAS Tabular instance?  Is your organization using Office 365?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might need Azure Analysis Services.  The wait is over! Azure Analysis Services is the platform as a service version of the wildly popular Analysis Services Tabular product. 

This demo heavy session will be focused on setting up Azure Analysis Services, deploying a model, loading the model with data and finally reporting from your Azure Analysis Services instance.</description>

      <title>The Analyst’s Guide To Finding and Fixing Performance Anti-Patterns</title>
      <description>Waiting too long for your SQL-based analytical jobs to finish? Need results in minutes instead of hours?

Bert Wagner, a principal business intelligence developer, regularly advises analysts and developers on how minor changes to their SQL-based jobs can dramatically improve performance. In this session he will show how to spot common anti-patterns that negatively impact performance, and apply solutions that will correct them.

Whether you strictly write SQL queries or incorporate those queries into tools like Python, R, Power BI, SAS, SSIS, etc… this session will teach you how to recognize poor-performing patterns in your queries as well as how to fix them for improved performance.</description>

      <title>Hey, You Got Your TDD in my SQL DB!</title>
      <description>When should we test our data? From an application development perspective, a unit test against a database isn't a unit test at all. Which makes sense -- connected systems introduce overhead and dependency, both of which reduce stability and decrease productivity during test-driven development (TDD). But if we wait for integration testing, critical functionality can get missed. In this session, we will discuss strategies for filling the data testing gap, directly within a Microsoft SQL Server environment. If you do a lot of work in T-SQL but aren't familiar with TDD, you'll learn the why and how of test-first development. If you're accomplished with unit tests, but never tried them in your database, you'll learn how to apply familiar concepts like setup, mocking, and assertion. We'll spend most of our time walking through a solution based on a real-world project, specifically using the open source tSQLt database unit testing framework.</description>

      <title>Extending Your Use of Extended Events</title>
      <description>If you have made the leap to using Extended Events, chances are you’re using Extended Events to do the exact same thing you used to do in Trace. Maybe you use it to capture query performance over time, or find queries that exceed a specific duration, I/O, or CPU.  Maybe you want to find what login executed a query, or from what workstation or application the query originated.  But Extended Events is so much more than a replacement for trace; it is a whole new way to think about troubleshooting.

In this session we will discuss the targets, actions, and predicates available in Extended Events and see how you can leverage them to look at problems in SQL Server in ways that you never could before. We will step through as many demos as possible in the time available so you can see why joining Team XE was one of the best decisions you ever made.  You’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of Extended Events along with a new methodology for approaching and solving issues in SQL Server.</description>

      <title>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #1: How the “Best Practice” Methods are Silently Killing Performance</title>
      <description>This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 1st of two back-to-back sessions, we'll learn how the current “Best Practice” Methods are actually a leading cause of perpetual logical and physical fragmentation, totally unnecessary wasted memory/disk space, costly/continuous “Bad” page splits, unexplainable blocking, comparatively insane amounts of log file generation and, in an interesting “Catch 22”, a major part of why we have to do so much index maintenance and how it all negatively impacts your code even if it’s perfect code.

We'll also discover the true costs of page splits, how REORGANIZE can perpetuate them, their effect on performance, introduce and learn how to use "sp_IndexDNA" to see indexes as you've never seen them before, and introduce methods to make even active GUID-based indexes 100% fragmentation free for months at a time, which will also fix the problems we’ve discovered.

This 1st session is also a recommended segue into the second session.</description>

      <title>“Black Arts” Index Maintenance #2: Better Methods that Can Actually Prevent Fragmentation for Weeks.</title>
      <description>This isn’t your typical presentation on Index Maintenance.

In this 2nd of two back-to-back sessions, we’ll learn the 5 main “Insertion Patterns” and how they cause or prevent fragmentation, introduce the additional page splitting/fragmenting horror of “ExpAnsive Updates”, continue to learn about the true costs of using REORGANIZE and why it should be avoided, how it all affects performance and disk/memory usage, how it all affects Index Maintenance, and steps that can be taken to seriously improve all of that. 

We'll also learn that simply reducing Fill Factors isn't the "fix" for fragmentation and can actually cost you serious amounts of additional totally wasted memory while providing little to no value.

Unfortunately, there won’t be time to cover it all but well documented code will be provided to help identify the sources of page splits and “ExpAnsive Updates” so that they can be eliminated.

Session #1 is a strongly recommend prerequisite for this session.</description>

      <description>Whether you’ve dabbled in PowerShell or wondered what all the fuss is about, make no mistake: PowerShell isn’t going away. It is definitely something worth learning to make your life as a SQL Server professional easier, and allow you to advance in your career as a DBA.

In this session, you’ll see practical, real-world examples of how you can blend SQL Server and PowerShell together. You’ll also get a look at the SQL Server PowerShell provider and how you can incorporate it into your automation scripts.

Instead of focusing on syntax, the session will plunge straight into examples and highlight various snippets of code and how they work. You can expect to see code examples on how PowerShell can do anything from comparing tables across servers, automating and centralizing your backups, and even doing in-depth security audits.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Data Compression</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2016 SP1 makes data compression available in all editions. Data compression can reduce storage costs, and provide a performance boost—and now compression is available without the added cost of Enterprise Edition. Whether you are a developer or a DBA, it's important to know how to use compression to save money and improve speed.

Come learn about how data compression actually works, the differences between ROW and PAGE compression, and learn how to pick the best compression level for your data. This session will cover the details of the compression algorithms, and the costs and benefits associated with each type of compression. 

By the end of this session, you'll have a better idea of how the different compression algorithms work, when compression is the right solution, as well as what type of compression to use.</description>

      <title>Help Me SSIS Logging, You're My Only Hope!</title>
      <description>When something goes wrong with your SSIS package and you need to tell your boss more than "I have a bad feeling about this…", let the Force of SSIS logging save you from the dark side!

SSIS logging may be the last thing on your mind when starting a new project, but getting it right in the beginning is well worth your while.  Logging can help troubleshoot errors, tackle inefficiencies, and even raise a red flag when there are issues in your data flow.  Newer versions of SQL Server have brought new options for logging.  Learn what information is available for each option along with how to implement custom logging when the built-in options aren't robust enough for your project's needs.</description>

      <title>Data Time Travel with SQL Server Temporal Tables</title>
      <description>Many times developers have to support users by answering the “What happened to the data?”  The task of retrieving data from a specific point in time is not an easy one.  Often this involves retrieving a backup and restoring the data in question (hopefully!).  SQL Server 2016 introduced Temporal Tables, allowing a developer to retrieve data from a specific point in time, without backups.  With a few TSQL commands a historical table can be created, automatically updated, and readily accessed.</description>

      <description>The Naïve Bayes series of algorithms are some of the simplest classification algorithms, but they tend to offer reasonably good results very quickly for a number of problems, including Natural Language Processing problems such as spam classification, as well as more classical feature-driven classification.  In this talk, we will look at the math behind Naïve Bayes classification, solving problems by hand before looking at a package in R which solves the problem for us.  By the end of this talk, you should be able to apply Naïve Bayes to existing problems.  No experience with statistics is required, although there will be a small amount of math.</description>

      <title>45 Minutes to Your First Tabular Model</title>
      <description>Have you been watching SSAS Tabular develop? What about the Azure Analysis Services product? Power BI's data modeling? These technologies are all effectively the same, but live in different places and can serve different roles. Now's the time to dive in and figure all of this out.
In this session, we will talk about what Tabular is and what it does, in addition to the various "flavors" it comes in. We'll explore development processes and will wind up with a model ready for ad-hoc querying through Excel or Power BI.</description>
