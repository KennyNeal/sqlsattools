      <description>On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.</description>

      <title>Upgrading SQL Server - Prepare for Success!</title>
      <description>It's (past) time to upgrade your SQL Server(s)! Where do you start? What version should you pick? How do you migrate? What about the downtime? ARGH!

Come to this session and take the stress out of your SQL Server upgrade project. In this session, we'll walk through all you need to think about and do before, during, and after your upgrade for success.  We'll answer your upgrade questions, but you'll also leave with the right questions to ask everyone else as you prepare for a successful SQL Server upgrade project.

We'll talk about successful upgrade checklists, best practices, why roulette is better than in-place upgrades, and how to minimize the strain on your users and teams during the upgrade. You'll leave with a working start on your upgrade checklist and plans, too!

Come on! Ditch those SQL Server 2008, 2012, and 2014 instances! Also, yes, we'll chat about the cloud some, too.</description>

      <title>What's New in SQL Server 2019: 100% Demos</title>
      <description>You haven't installed SQL Server 2019 yet, and you don't want to sit through a bunch of slides. You want to see a series of real-world demos focusing on the features of SQL Server 2019 that will make your users happier with as little work as possible on your part. You don't have time to rewrite all your queries or learn new languages - you just want the database to go faster.

I'm Brent Ozar, and I'll give you the whirlwind tour. I'll focus on just the features that make the biggest bang for the buck, things you can implement right away and see a noticeable difference. I'll show you what kinds of code will benefit the most so you can go back to the office and have an honest discussion with management about what to expect.

No slides here - not even an about-me slide. Let's dive into some queries!</description>

      <title>Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments</title>
      <description>Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.</description>

      <title>Keys to a Healthy Relationship with SQL Server</title>
      <description>Developers and DBAs have had a long, sometimes strained relationship. Some developers see DBAs as roadblocks standing in the way of getting their work shipped; some DBAs see developers as agents of chaos bent on ruining their perfect database environments.

In this talk designed for application and database developers, we’ll talk about why SQL Server behaves the way it does, common database and query design pain points, and how we look for them. With real-world examples and tales of troublesome T-SQL, past and present, you’ll start to get a picture of what to do and not to do in your applications. Along the way, you’ll learn how to build a better relationship with both SQL Server and the DBAs responsible for it.</description>

      <title>Will Query Store fix all my Performance Issues?</title>
      <description>How many of you cross your fingers and hold your breath when a new upgrade or new code goes live in production? Well you can breathe now and relax your fingers because in SQL Server 2016 Microsoft released Query Store. Query Store is like a flight data recorder for SQL Server, the black box in an airplane captures everything that occurs on a flight. In this session we will deep dive to learn how to configure (yes – you need to configure this black box – or it could crash your “plane”), use Query Store to troubleshoot database performance issues. I will show you multiple demos to capture baseline, understand query regression and how to force good execution plan. You will walk away with the knowledge of how to configure and use Query Store to help fix performance issues.</description>

      <title>How to audit and prevent unwanted user actions.</title>
      <description>Abstract:

Many corporations are composed of small divisions located in countries throughout the world. While you might be the lead DBA for your corporation, there are several other employees who have the keys to the kingdom. This presentation will review techniques on how to prevent and/or audit data and schema changes.

Coverage:

1 – Granting correct user access is vital.
2 – DML triggers to keep a DATA audit trail.
3 – DDL triggers to keep a SCHEMA audit trail.
4 – Preventing unwanted DATA modifications.
5 – Preventing unwanted SCHEMA changes.
6 – Preventing table TRUNCATIONS.
7 – LOGIN triggers to control who, what, and when.
8 – Change data capture (CDC) an alternative to triggers.
9 - Which of these techniques apply to an Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>Increasing SQL Server Availability Options Using SIOS DataKeeper</title>
      <description>Whether you are deploying on premises (physical or virtual) or up in a public cloud (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform), your SQL Server databases and instances need to be highly available. Some options, such as Always On Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs), are not easy to deploy when you need some form of shared storage and traditional storage methods are not accessible. Other times you have storage performance requirements in addition to availability that cannot be met by traditional solutions such as a SAN. Come to this session to learn how SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition can enhance your SQL Server deployments to help you achieve high availability, disaster recovery, and storage performance goals.</description>

      <title>Why should I care about ... the plan cache?</title>
      <description>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience.

Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs often seem so frazzled. This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</description>

      <title>Running Azure SQL Database Securely</title>
      <description>If you know your way around SQL Server, then you will find Azure SQL Database to be familiar territory. But some aspects are more familiar than others, which is especially true for security-related differences. 

In this session we review the key differences around identity management and authentication (including multi-factor authentication), managing server credentials (or, even better, not needing to in some cases), how to audit logins (probably not what you expect), an overview of encryption and data masking options, and the supporting role of Azure Key Vault. We will also touch on compliance and disaster recovery to give the complete picture of powerful features you'll definitely want to know about to protect your data. 

This talk will cover relevant capabilities for both traditional Azure SQL Databases and the newer Azure SQL Managed Instances.

This talk assumes you are already familiar with SQL Server or another enterprise database.</description>

      <title>Cosmic DBA - Cosmos DB for SQL Server Admins and Developers</title>
      <description>NoSQL is not just about having eventual consistency. Switching from a relational database to a NoSQL data store like Cosmos DB is a mind shift for SQL DBAs and developers used to thinking in terms of tables. Schema-free doesn’t mean you don’t have to think about the schema, but it does allow for faster changes and some interesting design patterns. 

This session will include a quick outline of Cosmos DB. Then it will move on to describe how indexing works, what the consistency levels all mean, and how your JSON should be designed based on your query patterns. And, I will toss in a high-level overview of the JavaScript triggers, stored procedures, and user defined functions for free. All of this will be presented using examples that are informed by my experience trying to convert a global application from SQL Server to Cosmos DB using the document model.</description>

      <title>Should This Be Normalized? When Database Normalization Seems Abnormal</title>
      <description>Ever since database normalization was introduced as a concept by Edgar Codd, there has been continuous debate on how far we should go to eliminate data redundancy. A new developer may be asking why there is a need to create multiple tables, and a DBA may be concerned that performance is being sacrificed. In this discussion, we’ll cover 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms, evaluate the pros and cons of normalization and denormalization for integrity and performance, and run through some examples with various data models. All to answer the question, "should...this...be...normalized?"</description>

      <title>Data Pipeline Best Practices for an Increasingly Cloudy World</title>
      <description>The cloud continues to become ever more prevalent in corporations around the world, disrupting traditional IT and forcing either adoption or early retirement. All too often, companies attempt a simple "lift and shift" approach that doesn't really net anything more than the Same Old App, now just running on someone else's server (and probably more slowly than it did in its old on-prem home). But the cloud does in fact have a large number of advantages for those of us doing complex data processing. To truly take advantage of its silver lining, you must go beyond lift-and-shift and fully embrace nativity. This session focuses on core concepts, combined with a heavy dose of real-world lessons gleaned while working to build cloud-based data platforms from the ground up. You'll learn why cloud storage and local storage can't be thought of as equivalent, why queues are the basis for pretty much everything in all of computing, and why you must start thinking about applications from the perspective of elasticity and eventual consistency rather than simple transactional functionality. You’ll leave this session with a fuller understanding of what it really takes to build a successful cloud application.</description>

      <description>Unless you've been stranded on a deserted island for years you've heard about all the data breaches that seem to happen every day. 

This means data security has never been more important which means SQL Server security has never been more important.

We'll take a high level look at security starting with physical security, see the two authentication modes, differences between logins and users, troubleshooting some common login issues, see how to gain access to a SQL Server and wrap up with security similarities and differences between on premise SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Always On Availability Groups</title>
      <description>Always On Availability Groups (AGs) have evolved since their introduction in SQL Server 2012. Not only is there the “classic” form of AGs, but now there are Basic Availability Groups, Distributed Availability Groups, Domain Independent Availability Groups, and Read Scale Groups. Also complicating the picture is virtualization, hyperconverged, the public cloud, Linux, as well as containers which is new to SQL Server 2019. Come to this session to learn what AGs are – and are not – today, the differences between the various AG and deployment options, and how you can harness the power of them in your environments.</description>

      <description>SQL Server Take Over:  Establishing a Baseline

Performance assessment and tuning for the beginner DBA
 
Have you ever inherited a group of servers with not a lot of documentation to accompany them?   Do you have a lot of undocumented or new servers in your environment and you want to establish some baseline configuration setting prior to making changes? You need up to date information on the system very quickly. 
 
The server is running slowly... or is it? Slow compared to what?  Before you being digging into performance issues, there are some baseline metrics you should have established. Only after the information has been gathered, can a plan of attack be developed to help resolve issues with performance. Attendees in this session will learn how to quickly  gather information, review the results and get an action plan on the next step in performance tuning.</description>

      <title>Introduction To SQL Server In Containers</title>
      <description>Finally, it's become easy for SQL Server developers and DBAs to use containers to speed up software development and testing. Containers have been around for more than 30 years, and at last they have become a great tool for Microsoft data professionals. Join Grant Fritchey to learn how containers differ from virtual machines, and why containers make it incredibly fast to deploy new instances of SQL Server. Grant will use Docker containers to demo the process of spinning up a new SQL Server using the very latest version of the product -- without actually installing SQL Server! Finally, you'll learn how containers can be used in the software development lifecycle to speed up the process of developing, testing, and deploying changes.</description>

      <title>Unexplored Features of SQL Server</title>
      <description>Every new version of SQL Server adds new features, some of these features are rarely talked about. Join me in this practical session to learn about some of the uncommon but useful features and data types of SQL Server.
We will start with exploring the hierarchyid, geometry and geography data types of SQL Server. We will look at the Temp tables and find a way to cache Temp tables for a better performance. We will cover sparse, rowversion columns and finish the session by showing a way to remove ORM from web applications by using JSON functions of SQL Server.</description>

      <title>CYA for the DBA</title>
      <description>Do you practice restores on a regular basis, but others in your organization do not? Are you worried that a restore may not be complete? As a DBA you are responsible for much more than simply backup and recovery of databases. This session will go over how to backup some SQL Server objects like Alerts, DBMail, LinkedServers, SQL Agent properties, and others with PowerShell. 
 
I have not always trusted others to be able to restore a machine. This talk walks through how to CYA in the event of an emergency by backing up SQL objects other than just the databases.</description>

      <title>Let's Dive Into SQL Server I/O To Improve T-SQL Performance</title>
      <description>Do you understand how SQL Server handles I/O? If not, you should. Understanding I/O is more important than ever with increasing cloud adoption, due to cloud costing models. But even on-premises, I/O has a direct impact on T-SQL performance.

Join me for a deep dive into the storage engine to understand how SQL Server handles I/O.  Concepts will be paired with T-SQL examples to illustrate the practical impacts. 

When you leave, you'll be able to optimize your T-SQL reduce I/O and improve performance across the board.</description>
