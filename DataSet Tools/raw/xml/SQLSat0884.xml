      <title>Encrypting Data within Sql Server</title>
      <description>Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep off of the data breach list? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt?  What else can you do to protect your sensitive data?

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption and Always Encrypted. The session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share my experiences implementing the encryption. In addition, the session will review auditing of sensitive data usage.  

You will leave the session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance.  In addition, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.</description>

      <title>Level Up: Data Modeling for the Power BI Rockstar</title>
      <description>In the world of Power BI, data modeling is what separates the Rockstars from the Rookies. Join me to learn how dimensional modeling - a concept developed 20+ years ago - continues to be the best approach for delivering self-service BI to the masses.

Not only will good data modeling result in better Power BI solutions that support a wider range of reporting requirements, but they will also be easier for the business users to understand and work with. 

In this session, you'll learn how to create flexible data models that can be expanded upon over time, unlock the power of the date table, and a variety of DAX patterns supporting common but complex business logic.
 
If your Power BI solutions typically contain a single table, if you're frequently banging your head against the wall trying to figure out how to write a DAX calculation, or if you've never heard the term "dimensional model" this session is for you.</description>

      <title>How to perform a health check</title>
      <description>Are you uncertain about the health and capacity of your SQL Server? Are you taking over a new server and need to get a better understanding of the health of the server? Are you uncertain if your servers are following industry best practices?

In this session we will start by discussing the importance of performing a Health Check. We will then show how to run the popular Blitz script by Brent Ozar. After that we will review the other key areas to check like the VM configuration, Windows Configuration, SQL Configuration, Security configuration, and Database configuration. Finally, we’ll show how to save the results for capacity and trending analysis

At the end of the session you will be able to: (1) Perform a Health Check on a server; (2) List the key areas for improvement; (3) Save the results for capacity and trending analysis.</description>

      <title>Indexing Like a Rocket Scientist</title>
      <description>Performance is what your users care about, and indexes can both improve and decrease
performance. As a SQL Developer, do you understand the difference between a clustered and
non-clustered index or what a covering index is? What is different between OLTP and data
warehouse databases when it comes to indexing?
This session is a deep dive into
 Clustered indexes
 Non-clustered indexes
 B-Tree traversal
 Primary Keys
 Covering indexes

This session will feature live query demos illustrating index utilization and performance using
statistics and query plans. Understand indexing like a rocket scientist by attending this session!

      <title>Managing Packages in Integration Services (SSIS)</title>
      <description>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) introduced the Catalog to help with managing project deployments, execution  monitoring. It was created to get rid of configuration files for packages in earlier versions. But what this has added is the ability to rollback a version, configure different environments as well as dashboard reports for monitoring.
This session will start with the installation and configuration of the catalog. The flow will change to the project management of packages. Here, project parameters will be used to configure different steps of a package and how this configuration can be shared with multiple packages. The project will be deployed as well as a single package deployment. The configuration will be changed at the SQL Server Agent Job and deployed project levels.  Environments will be setup to show development versus QA versus production. The report monitoring dashboard will conclude the session showing error messages as well as a package performance chart.</description>

      <title>How to Build Your Disaster Recovery Plan</title>
      <description>So your boss asked for a copy of your DR plan.  Once you've wiped that deer-in-the-headlights look off your face, you realize "We've got database backups," isn't exactly a plan.  You need to come up with a plan to recover your business when disaster strikes. This session will help you build this plan by defining what a disaster could be, documenting the business impact, and identifying your limitations.  We will show how to use this information to establish metrics (such as RTO and RPO), document current recovery configurations, and design an effective recovery strategy that meets the needs and budget of your business. Attending this session will give you the knowledge and tools to create an effective disaster recovery plan that will make your boss happy and ensure the continuity of your business.</description>

      <title>Understanding Deadlock Printouts in the Error Log</title>
      <description>You know to look out for deadlocks on your system. You know how to capture deadlocks to your error log. You know some techniques to apply to problem code to reduce deadlocks. But…

Going through the error log is a pain. There are many extraneous values. The details you want are buried in there somewhere, and don't always make sense. Why isn't it easier to find exactly where the deadlock is occurring?

Come walk with me through the error log to find all the details we need. There are many helpful details in the log you didn't know existed because they were hard to read. We can find out where in the code a deadlock happened, which objects deadlocked,  and why they deadlocked. We'll go through the extra values to help put meaning to them. After doing this a few times, it gets easier to find the main details you want, and have supporting evidence when you need it.</description>

Hint: You attend Revenge: The SQL! 
This session will show you how to "correct" all those bad practices. Everyone logging in as sa? Running huge cursors? Using SELECT * in ad-hoc SQL? Stop them dead, without actually killing them. Ever dropped a table, or database, or WHERE clause? You can prevent that! And if you’re tired of folks ignoring your naming conventions, make them behave with Unicode…and take your revenge!
Revenge: The SQL! is fun and educational and may even have some practical use, but you’ll want to attend simply to indulge your Dark Side. Revenge: The SQL! assumes no liability and is not available in all 50 states. Do not taunt Revenge: The SQL! or Happy Fun Ball.</description>

      <title>Adopting a Compliant Database DevOps Process</title>
      <description>Presented by Redgate 

DevOps is transforming software development, with many organizations and individuals adopting lean development practices, implementing Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and performing on-demand deployments to their production environments. However, the database is largely ignored and seen as a bottleneck for a DevOps software development process. We will discuss the challenges of database development and deployment and examine why many developers find the database to be an impediment. We examine the risks of sensitive data in the development process and how you can ensure that data security concerns do not get in the way of the need for speed and agility. We’ll look at how you can adopt a Compliant Database DevOps approach that removes the database bottleneck while ensuring compliance with regulations governing the use of data within your organization such as GDPR, HIPPA or SOX.  We’ll discuss the techniques used to include the data</description>

      <title>Migrate Your Database(s) with Distributed AGs</title>
      <description>You find yourself needing to migrate to new hardware or new operating system. If you're running SQL Server 2016+, you're in luck! Distributed Availability Groups (AGs) may just be the solution you want.

In this session I will explain the purpose and usages of Distributed AGs, create a Distributed AG and the associated AGs, and perform a mock data center migration.

NOTE: This session expects that attendees are already familiar with Availability Groups.</description>

      <title>Do I need to know about BIML? Of course you do!</title>
      <description>This topic will be about creating dynamic SSIS packages using BIML. Dynamic SSIS packages will help eliminate the hassle of having to manually change items in a Data Flow task when an underlying table change occurs. This talk will start from the ground up, showing a basic SSIS package, what it would take to create it dynamically in C#, and then the same package using BIML. While we will show some examples of BIML and C#, no experience in either of these is required, as the talk will be more concepts to get ideals flowing.

If you have data to move, BIML could be your new friend!</description>

      <title>A Primer on SQL Server Clustered Index Architecture</title>
      <description>How often when creating a new table you just made the Clustered Index using an Integer column with Identity properties.  Seems like that is all I have done for last many years.  But, in the last two years I’ve really dove into indexes and finally with this presentation looked at what really makes a good Clustered Index with benchmarks and varying scenarios.  In some scenarios a well-defined clustered index may out perform a covering non-clustered index.  Results are very interesting and may surprise you.</description>

      <title>Look, over there, your permissions are showing!</title>
      <description>You just walked into that fancy new gig, and you're getting your first cup of coffee.  Your boss walks up and asks, "Who has access to that prod server?", do you know how to get the answers in the next hour?  More importantly, do you know what these permissions mean, what an attacker could do with these permissions?  In this session we'll start from scratch assuming that you have no experience with an audit with this question in mind.  We'll work back from here to develop a strategy of how to harden your server.</description>
