      <title>Data Modeling and Prototyping in Power BI Desktop</title>
      <description>Power BI Desktop is often shown as a self-service reporting and analytics tool, but it can also be used earlier in the development cycle for prototyping and data modeling, doing it quicker and easier than other tools made for this purpose. 

In this session, we will go through multiple examples showing how Power BI Desktop is the perfect tool to quickly model data from multiple data sources (including web sites, databases, cubes, online services, and even flat files), and perform quick actions to cleanse and connect these various sources to each other using M and DAX functions built-in to Power BI Desktop. Once this model has been built, it can be used to create some quick reports to show how this will be used to help get a project approved/funded. Best of all, using Power BI Desktop to do all of this is completely free, no licensing or Power BI login required!</description>

      <title>Azure Analysis Services – Multidimensional solutions in the cloud</title>
      <description>Virtually all of today’s data solutions are hybrid solutions – partially in the cloud, partially on premises – as organizations attempt to fulfill an ‘all in the cloud’ mandate.  The reality is that cloud platforms like Azure do many things very well, but not all things, and functional gaps remain which complicate and sometimes prevent a full migration away from on premises environments.

Azure Analysis Services (AAS) is a good example of this reality – it works very well for many applications but is limited to Tabular Models and cost can explode if those models are not created thoughtfully.  And, what is the path to Azure for my multidimensional cubes? Do I care about Azure Analysis Services if I use Power BI?  As always the answer to these questions is a clear and absolute ‘it depends’.

In this session we’ll explore Azure Analysis Services functionality, fit in various solutions, and gaps and techniques that are important to consider when implementing AAS.</description>

      <title>SQL and MongoDB: When Two Worlds Collide</title>
      <description>Are you aware of the SQL and NoSQL worlds, but don't know why you would use both in the same sentence, let alone implement a hybrid solution? And then if you did want to set up such a system, where would you start?

After a quick overview of the SQL and NoSQL differences, we'll look at some scenarios where it makes sense to set up a hybrid environment to take advantage of the strengths of each database. Then we'll look specifically at accessing MongoDB from SQL Server.

Microsoft offers native integration with MongoDB in SQL 2019. We'll look at the mechanics of how to leverage that integration to archive data, feed a web farm, and provide more data to BI reporting.

We'll dig into querying normalized SQL and denormalized document db data structures simultaneously, and what that means for both data consistency and performance. Of course, this discussion wouldn't be complete without also knowing how to write to the document world from the relational world, so we'll cover that as well.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Select</title>
      <description>TSQL is one of the most valuable tools any SQL Server professional can add to their tool-set. More aptly, TSQL is a whole chest of tools for the SQL Server professional. One of the most important tools in that TSQL chest is a good understanding of the SELECT statement.

When was the last time you sat down to evaluate a SELECT statement? What actually goes into the processing of that teeny little word? There might be a fair bit more to this simple term than just fetching data from the database. This session covers the simplicity of the select. Then we take it a step further to dive into some of the complexities tied directly to this particular statement.

This session will help the attendee better understand the Select statement. With a more solid understanding of this statement, the attendee can return and implement some of this new knowledge to help improve processing and query response times in their own environments.</description>

      <title>Weird Stuff I Saw While … Supporting a Java Team</title>
      <description>After spending more than a decade completely devoted to the Microsoft stack, I did some time supporting a Java team. Yes, sure, Java is just another language so there aren't really and issues that are absolutely unique to the Java world. But it is a different stack, different culture, and different group of folks giving bad advice to developers ... just enough different to keep life interesting. Come hear about my misadventures with server side cursors, output parameters, integrated authentication, and NOCOUNT settings.</description>

      <title>ETL Best Practices and Techniques</title>
      <description>ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) is the backbone of any data project and can be upwards of 70% or more of the effort. The tools you have access to allow you to make progress in a hurry. However, are you implementing best practices and techniques that will scale to the demands you need? Or will you be refactoring far too quickly than you should to meet performance requirements?

Gian helpful insights from decades of lessons learned and walk away with best practices you can implement in your own ETL solution.</description>

      <title>Tally Ho! -- Explore the Varied Uses of Tally Tables</title>
      <description>Because SQL Server is designed to efficiently operate with set-based queries it does not perform as well with loops and cursors. However there are situations where you really need some type of a loop. Tally tables give you the best of both worlds by allowing you to effectively "loop" through records in a set-based manner.  We'll explore what tally tables are, how they work, and more importantly review some of the many ways you can use them to turn your loops and cursors into efficient set-based operations.</description>
