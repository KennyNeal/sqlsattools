      <title>Advanced analytics in the cloud: AzureML</title>
      <description>Everyone is talking about advanced analytics or data science these days and many companies are interested in taking their first steps in these new fields of data analytics. But how do you get started with new techniques like machine learning? What kind of new hardware or software do you need to buy to get started and how do you get your IT department to implement and support those choices?
Before you decide on designing an advanced analytics solution on-premises, why not give it a go on a platform that only charges money for the time you are actually using it? Azure Machine learning is a cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy and share analytics solutions with all the flexibility of the cloud. The perfect platform to start with advanced analytics without having to invest a lot of money!
In this session we are going to take a close look at AzureML, from how you can build your first machine learning model, to connecting AzureML to your on-premises SQL Server database!</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Terraform, Infrastructure as Code</title>
      <description>With ever increasing complexity in data platform and application solutions, it is becoming ever more important to take people out of the loop when it comes to system provisioning. Infrastructure as code is the way forward with Azure Resource Manager Templares, Google Deployment Manager, or AWS Cloud Formation.

This is where Terraform from Hashicorp can step in, one solution that has a provider model that will interact with Azure, AWS, Google, and others. Meaning that you only need to learn one syntax. Add that to the automation potential and now we have something that can really help get us down the road to infratructure as code.

This session will take an introductory look at how infrastructure can be defined as code and be shipped to standardise the deployment process and minimise the chance of mistakes creeping in when deployed by different memebers of Development or Operations.</description>

      <title>Mastering DML Operations like a master</title>
      <description>DML operations mean lot of work for the database engine of Microsoft SQL Server. Understanding the details of a DML transaction may give you great benefits when planning workloads for INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations.

Come and learn the differences of space allocation/deallocation between Clustered Indexes and Heaps in this demo oriented session. It will answer these questions:

What is the difference of data page allocation for heaps and clustered indexes?
What is the amount of transaction log when you update data in a heap and/or in a clustered index?
What are the differences when data are delete from a heap and clustered index?
Can ETL processes be improved by usage of the right strategy for INSERTS and DELETES?
What performance drawbacks will Page Splits and Forwarded Records have for my application design?</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting Power BI Report Performance</title>
      <description>So you've built a Power BI report with all the shinies? Good! 
After some usage, users have reacted that it's a bit sluggish in usage, and they're not keen on using it anymore.

Starting off with the new Performance Analyzer Pane, we'll demonstrate how you can pinpoint bottlenecks in your report, and take actions on these insights.

With the myriad of root causes that are out there, an elimination approach might suit us very well. 
Some of the main causes will be explained, and we'll get you going on how you can fix it for yourselves.

Be it DAX-measures, modelling issues, or an overload of visuals. 
Every report can be tuned to handle like a dream, and you can do it too!</description>

      <title>T-SQL advanced: Grouping and Windowing</title>
      <description>This session aims to explore all the features offered by the language T-SQL for aggregating and calculating data. There's much more of the clause GROUP BY.
With grouping and ranking functions you can calculate in your query grandtotal, running totals, find islands in intervals, select the last-not-null value, etc.
Windows functions apply directly on a set of rows defined by the OVER clause ("a window"). Windows function do not perform aggregation on group level and do not hide row details.
So they allow mixing detail and total elements in the same query.
The session is mainly based on a copious array of demos, to make explicit every concept introduced taking into account the impact on performances for every solution.</description>

      <title>How will we use Excel tomorrow?</title>
      <description>How is Excel changing, to keep up with the people's expectations of a modern BI tool?
Exciting times of endless possibilities and fast shifting demands of modern BI are proving to be a big challenge for products with nowhere near as long of a history as the one that Excel has. But if history taught us anything, it's that Excel will persevere and transform to fulfill all the user's needs.
This is a story of how Excel went from a single piece of data (a cell) focused application to a Rows (records), Columns and Tables focused application in a span of ten years with an explosion of possibilities in the last two.
We will breeze past the early staples like Power Query and Power Pivot to submerge ourselves into the world of New data types in Excel and finish on a high note of Dynamic Arrays in Excel showing how incredibly agile (considering the long tail it's got (history))  Excel is with a transformation of its core to open up the world of incredible possibilities.</description>

      <title>Implementing a new database platform for your modern data warehouse – Snowflake on Azure</title>
      <description>The “new database on the block” Snowflake, the data warehouse built for the cloud is now available on Azure with a strategic alliance with Microsoft. What makes the new platform worth over 4B and having the status of the fastest-growing SaaS solution in the analytics market? In the presentation, we will build a sample data warehouse, ingest the data using Azure Data Factory and look at the unique capabilities of the database comparing to the cloud alternatives (Azure SQL Datawarehouse, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift). The presentation will be based on the practical examples of use cases in the region and what I have learned regarding the new platform in the last 2 years. Lots of hands-on examples and integrations with Azure stack like Data Factory, Power BI and Azure Databricks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Query Processing in SQL Server 2019</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2017 started with query processing improvements called Adaptive Query Processing. Now, in SQL Server 2019, there are additional improvements; all of them are packed in a feature with a very promising name - Intelligent Query Processing. 
The intention of these improvements is to fix plans for poor performing queries due to wrong cardinality estimations and other sub-optimal plan decisions, and hereby enhance query performance with no code changes. 
This session will cover briefly all 2019 features: Batch Mode on Rowstore, Batch and Row Mode Memory Grant Feedback, Scalar UDF Inlining, Table Variable Deferred Compilation, and Approximate Query Processing. If time permits, you’ll see also Batch Mode Adaptive Join and Interleaved Execution.
After the session, you’ll understand how much improvements you should expect in your workloads, but also which of these features, and under which circumstances, can cause significant performance regression and how to overcome those issues.</description>

      <title>Adopting a Compliant Database DevOps Process</title>
      <description>Presented by Redgate 

DevOps is transforming software development, with many organizations and individuals adopting lean development practices, implementing Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and performing on-demand deployments to their production environments. However, the database is largely ignored and seen as a bottleneck for a DevOps software development process. We will discuss the challenges of database development and deployment and examine why many developers find the database to be an impediment. We examine the risks of sensitive data in the development process and how you can ensure that data security concerns do not get in the way of the need for speed and agility. We’ll look at how you can adopt a Compliant Database DevOps approach that removes the database bottleneck while ensuring compliance with regulations governing the use of data within your organization such as GDPR, HIPPA or SOX.  We’ll discuss the techniques used to include the data</description>

      <title>It's broken, now what? (Approaches to Practical Problem Solving)</title>
      <description>We've all experienced weird situations in IT - things break without any real apparent reason. Sometimes, error messages can be helpful, but mostly they are cryptic and lead to no real explanations/solutions.

In this session, I will show a few ways to approach problem solving in a practical and concise manner. Using real-world scenarios that I have run into in the past I will explain how I approached each issue. Sometimes by finding simple solutions, but sometimes having to be creative and employ methods that may not be so intuitive.

You will leave the session with a better understanding on how to approach solving any technical issues you experience at work.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Data Visualizations and Design Best Practices</title>
      <description>As the value of data is being recognized across the world, the ability to communicate data to your audience effectively is becoming a sought after skill for professionals. Thankfully, effective data visualization is not only a skill for artists and designers, anyone can improve their data presentation by choosing the right visuals and following best practices.
 
In this session, we will discuss how different types of visuals are perceived and which charts are best suited to each category. We’ll cover a basic introduction into colour theory, how to use colour effectively in reports, and how to create Power BI themes for your enterprise. Finally, you will learn an introduction to the design approach and how it helps us to tell a good data story.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Query Store Plan Forcing</title>
      <description>In this session, you will see Query Store in action and learn from many real-world examples, the author experienced in the last three years in the complex SQL Server production environment with heavy workloads. 
Plan forcing is a very powerful feature, but a bit controversial. This session will demystify it; you’ll see what Query Store exactly does when an execution plan is forced when it is respected, when and why isn’t, and the most important – when you have to force a plan in the production system, and when forcing can bring additional troubles. 
We’ll also cover in detail the automatic tuning. You will understand benefits and potential issues you can have with this feature and how to leverage it with no or minimal risk.</description>

      <title>Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew - Take It in Chunks</title>
      <description>Any SQL programmer with some experience knows that loops are bad and that you should work with all data at once in set-based statements. However, you may have experienced situations where this strategy did not work out well and you ran into problems like out-growing the transaction log or blocking other users.

You can solve this by operating on the data in chunks. Implementing chunking is not that difficult, but there are still pitfalls you can run into. In this session, I will discuss in what situations you may want to use chunking. I will give some best practices for how to implement chunking for good performance and I will highlight some things you need keep in mind, for instance, recovering from interruptions. 

I will also look at how you can use chunking for error handling: You want process many rows and you want the good rows to succeed even if some rows yield errors – something you cannot do in a single set-based statement.</description>

      <title>Docker  ASP.NET Core</title>
      <description>Containers are an increasingly popular way for deployment and application management. Regardless whether we have monolith applications or we make applications as a collection of micro-services, containers provide extreme portability and the possibility of running the same applications in different environments (on local machines, servers, cloud...) without any code or configuration changes. Docker is the leading container technology and Microsoft did a lot to enable it to run on Windows and Azure. Where do the ASP.NET Core applications fit into that picture? After the introduction to containers and Docker, we'll go through the basics of working with Docker from ASP.NET Core developer perspective.</description>

      <title>Strategies for solving compliance challenges</title>
      <description>According to Gartner, more than 80% of companies use sensitive data in dev and test. Hackers view non-production environments as a tempting target since they often have less rigorous security controls.

In this session, you’ll learn about the challenges that we, as technology professionals, face in our software development and administrative work. Learn compliant DevOps strategies for reducing your attack surface area by ensuring you know where sensitive data is located and avoid copying that data to non-production environments.</description>

      <title>Bringing AI to the edge - Azure Cognitive Services in docker containers</title>
      <description>Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) are a set of APIs, SDKs and services. They are available to developers to make their applications smarter, more engaging and easier to find. Cognitive services extend Microsoft's AI platform.

How can you use these API's if you don't want to send your data to an Azure Data Center? Not every data set should leave your company. That's why Microsoft now offers the whole thing as a docker image, which you can run on your own hardware. As a company, you regain control over your data.</description>
