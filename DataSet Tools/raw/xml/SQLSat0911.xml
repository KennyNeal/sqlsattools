      <description>Diane has worked with COZYROC since 2012. She has attended numerous SQL Saturdays to shine the light on the time-saving and capability-extending components and tasks that COZYROC offers in itâ€™s SSIS+ library. Without even having a background in databases or SQL Server, Diane successfully configures packages in live demonstrations that use COZYROC components and tasks. She believes that, if the toolkit is this easy to use for a novice, then just imagine what a SQL Server expert can do with it!

In Dianeâ€™s data networking days, Diane performed a variety of development-related and customer-facing roles for IBM, Lucent Technologies, North Carolina State University and Connectware.</description>

      <title>Build a Modern Data Warehouse from disparate sources with Apache Spark and Power BI</title>
      <description>A data warehouse (DW) is a core component of business intelligence and a central data repository for different sources. This poses many challenges as the schema definition for those sources may be completely different from one another. In this presentation, we discuss how to create a data warehouse model that can support data from multiple systems. Oscar Garcia shows how to build a dimensional model which can enable us to import the data with different shapes into a data warehouse. We then create processes to transform and load the data using Apache Spark. We finally use Power BI to visualize the data from our data warehouse and Spark.


Learning Objectives:

Challenges when using disparate data sources (different models)

Define a common model to support the different model shapes (Star Schema)

Apache Spark Overview

Strategy for loading the different data-sets into the common model

Data analysis and visualization with Power BI</description>

      <title>A Rocket Scientist Perspective on Index Column Selection</title>
      <description>Ever wonder how to select what columns need to be in an index definition and what columns should be in the INCLUDE clause.  This session will take a deep dive in looking at two SELECT queries on the AdventureWorks2017 database and what indexes give the best, adequate, and poor performance and their relation to disk space utilization.  Sometime what you have heard (word of mouth) is not always the overall best solution.  In addition ever wonder if covering indexes can be used for UPDATE statements -- answer is yes and a demo will show that.  And a final tidbit will be a demo how an unused index can affect a SELECT statement's performance poorly.  This session is about 60% demos and yields some surprising results.</description>

      <title>Deep Dive into Blocking and Deadlocks Troubleshooting</title>
      <description>SQL Server Concurrency Model is, perhaps, the most confusing and least understood part of SQL Server Internals. Blocking issues and deadlocks occur unexpectedly and negatively impact performance and user experience in the systems. Nevertheless, this model is well-structured and easy to understand when you analyze it from lock types and their lifetime, and compatibility standpoints. 

This, two-part session will explain why blocking and deadlocks occur, and how to troubleshoot them in your environments. First, it will provide the overview of SQL Server Concurrency Model and describe SQL Server locking behavior and root-causes of typical blocking issues. Next, the session will discuss how to capture and troubleshoot them using standard SQL Server tools, and how to simplify the analysis using Blocking Monitoring Framework developed by Dmitri.</description>

      <description>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</description>

      <title>Azure SQL DW. Redefining MPP, how it stacks against Snowflake and RedShift</title>
      <description>Data Warehousing has been traditionally deployed via on-prem MPP solutions, and due to cloud modernization, and datacenter reduction footprint initiatives, organizations are looking out to establish a relationship with a cloud solution that can help them get off the traditional storage and compute licensing scheme, to easily scale their workloads without spending millions in newly acquired hardware, and to reduce their database administration operational tasks. 
Snowflake, RedShift and Teradata provide a path to migrate workloads into the cloud and allows a very reduced utilization expense for both compute and storage. That is at least, what the marketing says as it has a tacit disclaimer around it. 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse offers scalability, pay-as-you-go compute solutions, with data contained within the database boundaries. 
The presentation shows a side by side comparison, with pros and cons of each platform and debunks some of the myths that have surfaced.</description>

      <title>How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS</title>
      <description>Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.</description>

      <title>Data Virtualization with PolyBase</title>
      <description>PolyBase is Microsoft's data virtualization technology, allowing you to integrate SQL Server with external systems such as Hadoop and Azure Blob Storage.  As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.</description>

      <title>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside</title>
      <description>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.</description>

      <title>Building Scalable Cloud Databases</title>
      <description>Usually when developers and DBAs talk about scaling databases we mean 'scaling up' our database server to handle the increased demands of our users.
But what if 'scaling up' isn't the only or best answer? 
What if we're building a multi-tenant SaaS application, and want to have a single front-end for each of our clients, but have multiple back-end databases to segregate customer data?
In this talk, we'll look at ways we can scale our SQL Server Databases 'out' instead of 'up'.
We will touch on a few database design considerations before diving into the Elastic Database Client libraries to see how we can add intelligent data-dependent-routing to our applications, ensuring that each request is routed to the correct database. 
Finally, we will explore how Azure Elastic Database Pools can be used to optimize our database workloads in Azure.</description>

      <title>SQL Server is not an excuse to avoid DevOps</title>
      <description>Working as a DevOps consultant in the field I hear this excuse all the time: "We can't do DevOps, we use a SQL database"
Handcrafted database deployments take days and are extremely fragile. This often leads DBAs to the misconception that introducing DevOps - which naturally leads to an increased cadence in deployments - will result in DBAs doing deployments all the time and with more breakages. We will dispel this misconception by showing how DevOps automation and a little discipline allow better testing, shorter release cycles, and reduced business risk. We will also discuss some techniques and best practices for introducing DevOps for SQL Server deployments.</description>

      <description>This session focuses on the all PaaS solution of Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance (MI) + SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to lift  shift, modernize, and extend ETL workflows. We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) â€“ dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS â€“ with SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL DB/MI, configure it to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection/Self-Hosted IR as a proxy, and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will next show you how to use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to design/test/deploy/execute your SSIS packages in the cloud just like you do on premises. We will finally show you how to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking/scheduling SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combining/chaining them with other activities, allowing you to trigger your pipeline runs by events, automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, etc.</description>

      <title>In-Place vs Side-by-Side SQL Upgrades; Clearing the Confusion</title>
      <description>Most of us are aware that when it comes to upgrading our SQL Servers, we have a couple different options when it comes to the methodology.  Do we perform an In-Place upgrade or a Side-by-Side?  Both options come with a myriad of pros and cons, and there's usually a "best" solution for every environment.  This session will attempt to examine exactly which scenarios lend themselves best to each technique, and we'll provide a logical way of thinking about this critical step and how to accomplish this with the least stress.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Agile</title>
      <description>Agile software development is more than frameworks such as Scrum, Extreme Programming or Feature-Driven Development (FDD).

Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, it's generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context.

Join us to learn how to apply this principles in real day to day activities.</description>

      <title>Look, over there, your permissions are showing!</title>
      <description>You just walked into that fancy new gig, and you're getting your first cup of coffee.  Your boss walks up and asks, "Who has access to that prod server?", do you know how to get the answers in the next hour?  More importantly, do you know what these permissions mean, what an attacker could do with these permissions?  In this session we'll start from scratch assuming that you have no experience with an audit with this question in mind.  We'll work back from here to develop a strategy of how to harden your server.</description>

      <title>Linked Servers - Creating, and Using</title>
      <description>Linked servers in SQL have been around for a very long time, but still can cause lots of headache when configuring one for use.  In this session, we will dive in the the multiple creation, security, and configuration options that can be so important to making them work successfully.  In the last part, we will cover the different syntax available over linked servers and when best to use one over the other, with some real life examples.</description>

      <title>Why You Should Consider Implementing Indexed Views</title>
      <description>This session will include an explanation of what indexed views are, the types of problems that they solve, and their limitations.  Additionally, I will provide a methodology for determining whether or not you should consider using indexed views to solve problems in your environment - including how to test and compare them to some alternatives.  I will then go through some demos and provide more opportunities for the audience to ask questions.</description>

      <title>Migrate Your Database(s) with Distributed AGs</title>
      <description>You find yourself needing to migrate to new hardware or new operating system. If you're running SQL Server 2016+, you're in luck! Distributed Availability Groups (AGs) may just be the solution you want.

In this session I will explain the purpose and usages of Distributed AGs, create a Distributed AG and the associated AGs, and perform a mock data center migration.

NOTE: This session expects that attendees are already familiar with Availability Groups.</description>

      <title>Temporal Tables - Managing Large Data Sets and Their Effects on Performance</title>
      <description>So, you installed SQL 2016 (or newer) and implemented Temporal Tables for some of your data.  Everything is running well, but now what?  In this session we will look at the effects of adding various indexes to both the main and the history table and discuss what that might mean to the front end performance.  We will go into data management scenarios, for when you do not want to keep all the data in that table forever.</description>
