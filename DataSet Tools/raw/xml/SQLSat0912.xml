      <title>T-SQL Window Function Deep Dive</title>
      <description>Join this session and learn everything you need to know about T-SQL windowing functions!

SQL Server 2005 and later versions introduced several T-SQL features that are like power tools in the hands of T-SQL developers. If you aren’t using these features, you’re probably writing code that doesn’t perform as well as it could. This session will teach you how to avoid cursor solutions and create simpler code by using the windowing functions that have been introduced between 2005 and 2012. You'll learn how to use the new functions and how to apply them to several design patterns that are commonly found in the real world.

You will also learn what you need to know to take full advantage of these features to get great performance. We’ll also discuss which features perform worse or better than older techniques, what to watch out for in the execution plan, and more.</description>

      <title>SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases</title>
      <description>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</description>

      <title>Predictive Analytics with R in Power BI</title>
      <description>Power BI reports are typically used for descriptive analysis: a historical look of what has happened. But what if your report could visualize what is likely to happen and recommend what you can do about it now? This session will cover how to shift from descriptive to predictive analysis and leverage the power of machine learning to enhance your business intelligence solutions. The basics and best practices of predictive modeling will be introduced, and these concepts will be applied to create three predictive models in R using three different techniques. We will then walk through the three different ways to integrate the predictive power of these models into a Power BI report.</description>

      <description>Reporting requests that are required ‘yesterday or sooner’, oft times necessitate working more efficiently and effectively. We have all been through this at one time or another.
In this hands on presentation we shall be looking some of the more challenging techniques of extracting our data from our Multidimensional and Tabular Models, in addition to our Data Mining Models. 
We shall be utilizing concepts of  ‘Openquery()’ and ‘linked servers’ as a means to extract data,  in addition to looking at the way that these two concepts can help us extract our data utilizing MDX, DMX and DAX expressions;  AND YET maintain the  flexibility and the ability to utilize all those wonderful techniques that may  be done with T-SQL.</description>

      <description>This session focuses on the new features to unblock/accelerate cloud migration of legacy SSIS, such as 2008 or earlier versions, with Azure Data Factory (ADF). We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will next show you how to enable the following scenarios: running SSIS packages stored in file shares as first-class activities in ADF pipelines, accessing Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance with OLEDB/ADO.NET connectors configured for Azure Active Directory authentication with ADF managed identity, configuring SSIS IR to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection/Self-Hosted IR as a proxy, running/debugging SSIS packages in ADF from SSDT, scheduling SSIS jobs in ADF from SQL Server Agent/3rd party orchestrators that invoke Azure-enabled dtexec.exe command line utility, etc.</description>

      <description>Has your manager come to you and said "I expect the SQL Server machines to have zero downtime?" Have you been told to make your environment "Always On" without any guidance (or budget) as to how to do that or what that means? Are you facing pressure to have data in Azure as well? Help is here! This session will walk you through the high availability options in on-premises SQL Server, the high availability options in Azure SQL Database and Managed Instances, and how some or all of those can be combined to enable you to achieve the ambitious goals of your management. Beyond the academic knowledge, we'll discuss frequently seen scenarios from the field covering exactly how your on-premises environments and Azure services can work together to keep your phone quiet at night.</description>

      <title>Networking 101: Building professional relationships</title>
      <description>Networking. You keep hearing that word throughout your career development, but you don’t know much about it, much less, how to do it. You want to connect with technical and data professionals, so you attend events such as SQL Saturday and your local user group. But what about your book club, your gym, your church group, or your kid’s soccer game? Those are prime — and overlooked — opportunities to network!

In this interactive session, we will discuss networking — what it is, why it’s important, and where opportunities exist. You will even have an opportunity to practice networking within the confines of our room. You might even leave this session with new networking contacts that you didn’t previously have!</description>

      <title>Easing the pain of database migrations, a closer look at the new cloud citizen - DMS</title>
      <description>An essential part of migrating your application workload to the cloud is how to transfer your data securely to its new home. If you in addition want to change the underlying database system, for instance Oracle to SQL Server, it can quickly escalate to an overwhelming task. What if your application have a very high uptime requirement and your database is so large that you don't have a downtime window long enough to do a traditional backup/restore operation?
In order to overcome these pain points we have now available, both in Azure and AWS, services and tools that alleviate these pains and brings your valuable data safely across with near-zero downtime.

In this talk we will:
- Guide you through how to set up a migration process with checks and balances
- Compare the schema analysis and conversion tools provided by AWS and Microsoft
- Compare the migration services provided by AWS and Azure
- Demonstrate near-zero-downtime migration for a live database on AWS and Azure</description>

      <title>New features in Management Studio  -- Performance Troubleshooting made easier!</title>
      <description>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools.  Which enabled rapid enhancement to Execution Plan.  

Do you know that you can now see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for the operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for an execution and what trace flags were active during compilation and which ones influenced compilation? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for table name, index name or column name without opening XML plan? When you see a clustered index was used do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows? 

In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan.  You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.</description>

      <title>SQL Server Availability Groups for dummies</title>
      <description>Availability Groups have become Microsoft’s default high availability and scalability go-to solution for SQL Server, but due to their relative complexity is often misunderstood, or worse, feared. 

In this session, we will explain how to plan for, deploy, and manage Availability Groups from the ground up in easy to understand examples and demos.

We will cover both Basic Availability Groups (BAGs) and full deployments, and also cover their use in Windows and Linux environments as well as look at the new SQL Server 2019 availability group support on containers in a Kubernetes cluster.

If you want to finally get to grips with SQL Server Always On Availability Groups, then this is the session for you!</description>

      <title>High Availability and Disaster Recovery for SQL Server in Azure IaaS</title>
      <description>The CEO just tasked you with moving all the SQL Server instances to Azure, or maybe you are deploying a brand new application and want to leverage Azure IaaS to host SQL Server. Beyond security and performance, your most pressing concern might be ensuring SQL Server running in Azure is highly available.
 
While on-prem high availability and disaster recovery options for SQL Server are well defined, moving those instances to Azure immediately presents some questions and challenges. Can I simply lift and shift my SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance to the cloud? Do I need to upgrade to SQL Server Enterprise Edition and us Always On Availability Groups? What about shared storage and failover clustering? What about disaster recovery, what are my options there? Load Balancers, Fault Domains, Availability Zones, Azure Site Recovery and Region Pairs, what are these things and why do they matter to me? 

Cloud  Datacenter MVP David Bermingham takes explains all this and more in the session.</description>

      <description>This session focuses on the all PaaS solution of Azure SQL DB/Managed Instance (MI) + SSIS in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to lift  shift, modernize, and extend ETL workflows. We will first show you how to provision Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) – dedicated ADF servers for running SSIS – with SSIS catalog (SSISDB) hosted by Azure SQL DB/MI, configure it to access data on premises using Windows authentication and Virtual Network injection/Self-Hosted IR as a proxy, and extend it with custom/Open Source/3rd party components. We will also show you how to migrate SSIS packages + jobs using Data Migration Service and use the familiar SSDT/SSMS tools to manage them in the cloud just like you do on premises. We will next show you how to modernize your ETL workflows by invoking/scheduling SSIS package executions as first-class activities in ADF pipelines and combining/chaining them with other activities, allowing you to automatically (de)provision SSIS IR just in time, etc.</description>

      <title>Version control with GIT for the DBA</title>
      <description>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. Microsoft has fully embraced Git. It powers modern on premise and cloud versions of TFS (now know as Azure Devops) as well GitHub, which Microsoft recently acquired. 

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in VCS. 

In my session. We'll cover:

Why should I store my schema in SSDT to help prevent developers from using code first ORMs.
What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.</description>

      <title>What is kusto query language?</title>
      <description>As data professionals makes progress in their migration to cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella ‘Azure Monitor’. One of the primary sources of monitoring is ‘Azure Monitor logs’ (which is also knows as Log Analytics). Azure Monitor logs are built on Azure Data Explorer which uses the Kusto query language. Going forward, the Kusto language should be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log.  In this demo intensive session, I will show you some ‘getting started’ tips and a few sophisticated queries using Kusto.

I have invested a lot of effort and received expert advice from Microsoft Engineers in learning how to work with Azure Monitor Log.  Sharing what I have learned is going to save time and effort for anyone that will be responsible for managing resources in Azure.</description>

As of SQL Server 2019, PolyBase also allows you to connect to diverse systems such as Oracle, MongoDB, Cosmos DB, Teradata, Apache Spark, and even other SQL Server instances.  In this talk, we will walk through the mechanics of PolyBase, showing how we can write T-SQL queries to access data from heterogeneous sources.  We will investigate the Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) and other resources needed to tease out what the PolyBase engine is doing behind the scenes and where to go when things break down.  Finally, we will look at several interesting use cases for PolyBase in the modern data environment.</description>

      <title>Effective Data Warehouse Storage Patterns</title>
      <description>Many companies start off with a simple data mart for reporting. As the company grows, users become dependent on the data mart for monitoring and making decisions on Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

Unexpected information growth in your data mart may lead to a performance impacted reporting system. In short, your users will be lining up at your cube for their daily reports.

How do you reduce the size of your data mart and speed up data retrieval?  This presentation will review the following techniques to fix your woes.

Techniques:
1 – What is horizontal partitioning?
2 – Database sharding for daily information.
3 – Working with files and file groups.

      <title>PowerBI and PowerApps Married at First Sight</title>
      <description>PowerBI is Microsoft's self service reporting tool that give businesses a robust visualization of their data. As Microsoft's Power Platform has evolved, PowerApps is taking a similar approach by providing businesses with a self service application tier. In this session we will see the power of bringing the two together. Let's explore how the visualization tier of PowerBI can enhance the development and capabilities of PowerApps.  We will go from a blank canvas app and import visualizations while pointing out some of the pros and cons of marrying the two together. We will use the capabilities of PowerApps to write and update our SQL Server tables. Bringing the two together can provide businesses with a robust solution under one umbrella. Join me in learning how these two services came together and said "I DO".</description>

      <title>Approaching Zero:  Minimizing Downtime During Deployments</title>
      <description>Negotiating a downtime for a release can be difficult in this modern, 24x7 world.  When downtime means lost revenue, the price of taking a downtime to deploy code can run up quickly.  This talk will show you a way to reduce the cost of deployment by reducing or even eliminating required downtime for database code deployment.  We will show how to release new database code, update existing stored procedures, refactor and restructure tables, and even perform systemic re-architecture with no downtime and minimal blocking.  We will use as a case study one release in which we modified the primary key column on 180 tables and updated over 550 stored procedures without end users noticing a thing.  If you want to hit that three nines (or better) service-level agreement, this talk will help get you on the road to reduced downtime.</description>

      <title>I have indexes, but do I have the right indexes?</title>
      <description>Do you have all the right indexes on your SQL Server databases?   Have you implemented any indexes other than traditional clustered and non-clustered indexes?  If the answer to either question is a “no” or an “I don’t know”, then this session is for you.

This session will help introduce less commonly used index types and settings along with indexing methodologies.  Follow along while we learn which indexes your SQL Server is begging you to make and others it wishes you would drop.  Learn use cases for filtered, full-text, and columnstore indexes.  There will be plenty of demos and shareable scripts to showcase the benefits too!

Are you using a version and edition of SQL Server is able to use these features?  We’ll cover that too and you’ll leave this class with a repeatable indexing methodology you can use to improve your database performance.</description>

      <title>Database DevOps with Visual Studio and Jenkins</title>
      <description>Are your database releases time-consuming, complicated, and exception-driven?  Do you wish you could deploy just a few of the changes from database 1 to database 2?  Does your boss say “we should do more of this DevOps stuff”?  Time to think about automation.

Keeping your “desired state” database in version control is the first step toward easy, repeatable deployments.  When your database contains exactly what it’s supposed to, there’s no such thing as “but it worked in Dev.”  And that’s just the beginning.

Join Larry Blake and Shantan Kallu from Teach for America to learn how they created custom Jenkins pipelines to automate deployments, run unit tests, introduce code review approval steps, manage logins, and more.  No Jenkins knowledge is assumed.</description>

      <title>How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS</title>
      <description>Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.</description>

      <description>The database is sometimes one of the last areas considered when planning DevOps for new and existing projects. If you are new to Azure Pipelines or Database Projects in Visual Studio this presentation will show you how to combine these technologies to create a consistent database deployment across all your development environments. If you are already using Azure Pipelines and Visual Studio for your applications, you will learn how to include your database. We will go over creating a database project and deploying a Dacpac manually to multiple environments. I will point out things to consider and how to add custom deployment scripts and build validation. Then we will setup an Azure DevOps account and step through creating a pipeline to automatically deploy a data project stored in a git repository. We'll also use Key Vault to store the deployment credentials to avoid sharing around that password everyone uses to deploy manually.</description>

      <title>Protecting Distributed and Legacy SQL-based Applications</title>
      <description>Encryptionizer for SQL Server is a cost-effective alternative to upgrading to SQL Enterprise for TDE. Encryptionizer works with all versions and editions of SQL Server from Express to Enterprise.  It is deployed by a simple point-and-click interface.
However, what if you are, say, a commercial developer or device manufacturer with hundreds or even thousands of customers who need to come into compliance? You obviously don't want to do a point-and-click deployment on each one. This session will show how you can use Encryptionizer's script-based deployment to install on one or ten thousand machines (even Legacy machines) with no programming and no user interaction.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Always Encrypted</title>
      <description>This will be an introduction to the Always Encryption feature introduced in SQL Server 2016 . Unlike Transparent Data Encryption Always Encrypted provides encryption in transit as well as encryption at rest. There will be a survey overview of both the operations and development side of Always Encrypted. However, the main focuses will be  porting considerations, certificate management, integrating Always Encrypted into a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD chain) and using Azure Keyvault for increased certificate security.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator is part of an execution plan. When an execution plan has a CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator, this is a signal that “your statement has a problem”. This presentation will show you how to detect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator; how to find the statement that causes conversion, and what DMVs can help to solve the problem. It will also show you the solution to collect the Execution Plans with CONVERT_IMPLICIT operator across the servers.</description>

      <title>Building a proper indexing strategy</title>
      <description>Indexes play a crucial role in database performance. Proper indexes will significantly reduce query run times and reduce resource consumption. However if we do not take care when creating indexes we can actually hurt performance. To that end it is important to understand what makes for a good index as well as how to properly maintain indexes. In other words we need an indexing strategy.

In this session we will cover the following:

Heaps
Clustered vs non clustered indexes
How the optimizer determines what indexes to use – Statistics!
How to determine good indexes
How to implement proper index maintenance / Common strategies</description>

This is a level 300 presentation which we will look at:
1). The analytical engine behind Power BI (called Vertipaq Engine), 
2). An overview of the query architecture of each DAX query,
3). How to optimize the query performance.

      <title>Is Physical Still An Option for SQL Server Deployments?</title>
      <description>With the push towards virtualization and the public cloud, are there people still deploying physical SQL Server architectures? The answer is yes. However, the answer should not always be yes. As we move towards an increasingly cloudy world, when does it make sense to deploy physical hardware? What do those solutions look like in 2019 since things have evolved quite a bit in the past few years with options like hyperconverged? This session will cover when you may want to consider - and when you probably don't want - physical solutions.</description>
