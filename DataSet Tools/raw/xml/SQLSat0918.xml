      <description>On Jan 12, 2019, Peter attended his first SQL Saturday and experienced an engaging and uplifting community that encouraged everyone regularly to give back. That experience resulted in teaching eleven sessions and delivering a SQL Fundamentals pre-conference the last six months of the year.  He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work. Managers took notice of the results and transferred him to the reporting department. A few months later, a co-worker suggested he should learn SQL Server and his world of data has never been the same.</description>

      <title>What You Need To Know About Processing Tabular Models and Power BI Datasets</title>
      <description>Ever wondered what's happening under the covers when processing a tabular model or a Power BI dataset? Why is it taking so much memory? How can I make it run faster? Am I running into a resource bottleneck?

Processing a tabular model can be a very resource-intensive workload and depending on your specific goals (e.g. speed, availability, etc) it may not always be feasible to process the entire model.

In this session, you'll learn what actually happens and in what order during model processing, the difference between the various processing types, performance considerations and most common resource bottlenecks. We'll also cover the most common processing patterns and the associated trade-offs.

      <title>How to automate row level security in Power BI using DAX and SSAS</title>
      <description>Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share insights across your organization or embed them in your app or website. This session is for users are who want to automate Power BI row-level security by replicating the security of another data source such as corporate ERP. Many organizations maintain tight data security within their organization. Row-level security needs to be defined within Power BI. This can be difficult if you have many users and security changes happen quite often. If you are using a corporate ERP system that has security built into it, you would end up doing redundant work of managing security at two places, in ERP as well as in Power BI. DAX query can be used to filter out rows based on user ID/user name. We will go over the demo of the entire process starting from bringing data into SSAS, creating data model, applying row level security  publish the report. Never again you will have to manually manage roles within Power BI.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Backup Performance Using Data Science Techniques</title>
      <description>One of the most important tasks for a database administrator is taking (and testing!) backups.  As databases get larger and larger, the amount of time it takes to perform a backup can grow as well, to the point where your backups take longer than your available backup window.  There are several settings we can use to optimize backup performance, such as buffer counts, maximum transfer size, and the number of files, but trying every combination of settings on a single production-sized database could take weeks or even months.  In this talk, we will apply data science techniques to the problem of backup settings optimization and look at different models for approaching the problem and analyzing data.  Some statistics background would be helpful, but is not required; the big requirement is a desire to speed up backups.</description>

      <title>Improve distributed system and web app performance by using in-memory cache system</title>
      <description>Applications often integrate with APIs for the purpose of retrieving data from a disk-based storage system like SQL Server. This poses challenges due slow queries and amount of data sent down the wire. In this presentation, we discuss the performance concerns with this type of architecture especially for big data scenarios.  Oscar Garcia shows how to address those concerns by following a series of steps in which an application is refactored with minimum changes to support an in-memory data store and data streaming.  We start by discussing the challenges when using data queries. We structure the data for in in-memory storage. We replace the API requests with real-time data streaming.

Learning Objectives:

SQL Server Query Challenges

Redis Cache Basic Operations and Structure

Angular App with Socket.io integration

Node.js Backend with Socket.io and Redis support

Real-time data integration</description>

      <title>Module Signing: Use Certificates to Replace TRUSTWORTHY, EXECUTE AS, and Cross-DB Pwnership Chaining</title>
      <description>We often need to grant a higher-than-ideal level of permissions to a Login or Role so that someone can: start a SQL Agent job (but you don't want them to edit anything), get data from a DMV that requires "VIEW SERVER STATE" permission (but that permission gives access to too much data), query across databases, TRUNCATE a table, etc. These problems are usually solved with some combination of: EXECUTE AS (i.e. Impersonation), cross-DB ownership chaining, or TRUSTWORTHY ON. Unfortunately, those options are all security risks.

Module Signing — https://ModuleSigning.info/ — is more flexible and secure, but requires a Certificate or Asymmetric Key. Those can be confusing to work with, and the security mechanism isn't intuitive. However, that confusion ends here.

Come learn how to have more secure, granular permissions that handle cross-DB tasks, Dynamic SQL, and SQLCLR. See what module signing can do, how certificates and asymmetric keys work, and realize it's not as hard as you thought.</description>

      <title>Version control with GIT for the DBA</title>
      <description>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed the version control system (VCS) git. Since then, it has become as platform agnostic and ubiquitous as the internet. Microsoft has fully embraced Git. It powers modern on premise and cloud versions of TFS (now know as Azure Devops) as well GitHub, which Microsoft recently acquired. 

What does this mean to a DBA? Whether or not you use SSDT, you should be storing your database schema in version control. In addition, your utility scripts certainly belong in version control.

In my session. We'll cover:

How do I use SSDT to help prevent developers from using code first ORMs?
What is version control?
How does a distributed version control system differ from traditional version control like Visual Sourcesafe, TFS, and SVN?
How do I setup git for internal use in my company?
How do I host public and private repositories on github.
How do pull requests work?
We will be covering using git from both the command line and Visual Studio.</description>

      <title>Working with Multiple DBMS Platforms: You're Not in Kansas Anymore</title>
      <description>Imagine you have a new employee with valuable SQL experience, but from a different DBMS platform.  Or imagine you’ve been assigned to a project that involves a DBMS other than SQL Server.  What do you need to know?  In this high-level presentation, Sandra will highlight differences between default Windows installations of Oracle, Postgres, DB2, SQLite, MySQL, and SQL Server.  She’ll share her experience moving from one platform to another and what she has found to be the most important thing to keep in mind when working with a new DBMS or working with a new employee who comes from another DBMS environment.

This presentation is for anyone with a basic knowledge of SQL.  It was co-produced with Stéphane Faroult, author of The Art of SQL, SQL Success and other technical books.  The presentation uses techniques found in his latest book, Getting the Message Across: Using Slideware Effectively for Technical Presentations.</description>

      <description>The job of a data professional is evolving rapidly, driving many of us to platforms and technologies that were not on our radar screen a few months ago. I am certainly no exception to that trend. Most of us aren't just monitoring backups and tuning queries - we are collaborating with teams throughout the company to provide them data and insights that drive decisions. Cloud providers are democratizing technologies and techniques that were complicated and proprietary just a few months ago. This presentation walks you through how a silly idea from a football podcast got me thinking about how Azure Logic Apps, the Cognitive Services API, Azure SQL DB, and Power BI combine to provide potentially powerful insights to any company with a social media and sales presence. Join me as I walk you through building a solution that can impact your company's bottom line - and potentially yours too!</description>

      <title>A Beginner's Guide to Using GIT</title>
      <description>Source Control is a wonderful resource to improve team collaboration, reduce the risk of problems from lone wolf development and track change efficiently. Developers are already familiar with source control, but ANY Analysts or Operations teams can benefit! If you are struggling to use source control, are frustrated with not understanding the what, why, and how, or want to start using source control then look no further!  We will cover using source control for code in stored procedures and queries for SSMS, SSIS packages, SSAS models and cubes, and SSRS reports.

With this session, you will learn the foundational knowledge to not only to apply to your workplace right away but to lay the groundwork to continue building your skills in Git. We will cover basic terms/concepts of how Git works, understanding the process flow, executing some basic commands in Git, understanding why a merge conflict happens and how to solve it, and using different GUIs if the command line isn't your thing.</description>

      <description>Aggregations are one of the most important optimization methods for managing big datasets in Power
BI. Combined with Direct Query storage mode, they allow big datasets to be analyzed efficiently by
answering high level analytical queries quickly from memory while sending more detailed queries back
to the source database.
In this session, you will learn about the concept of aggregations, different table storage modes in Power
BI, how to set up aggregation tables and configure them to improve query performance. You will also
learn how to use DAX Studio to determine if the aggregations are being used.

      <title>More Common Than You Think: Mental Illness in Tech</title>
      <description>Mental illness is more common than you think.  One in four Americans suffers from a mental illness each year.  In the tech community, this is often not talked about.  Many times, people feel alone and isolated in the tech community with us mostly being introverted people.  It is time to start talking about mental illness out in the open and honestly about how it affects us and those around us.

In this session, we will talk about what mental illness is and what it is not.  How my mental illness has affected me.  How it effects the tech industry.  How mental illness can affect you and how you can tell if you are starting to have issues.  What to say and what not to say to people you know that are affected by mental illness.  Finally, how to get help and where reach out for help.</description>

      <title>Intro to SQL Server Internals and Architecture</title>
      <description>Let’s face it.  You can effectively do many IT jobs related to SQL Server without knowing the internals of how SQL Server works.  Many great developers, DBAs, and designers get their day-to-day work completed on time and with reasonable quality while never really knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it’s critical to know SQL Server’s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:
-       What are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?
-       How are queries handled behind the scenes?
-       What does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?
-       What happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?
-       How are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?
-       What happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?</description>

      <title>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside</title>
      <description>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.</description>

      <title>Performance Tuning, Getting the Biggest Bang for Your Buck</title>
      <description>Everyone wants to know if there are magic buttons you can push to make SQL Server run faster, better and more efficiently. In this session we will go over some of my go-to performance tricks that you can implement to get the biggest improvement with the least amount of change.  When it comes to performance tuning, every second counts. We will cover memory optimization, isolation levels, trace flags, statistics, configuration changes and more.  I’ll go over real life scenarios we come across as consultants and the changes we made to fix them.</description>

      <title>Using DMVs for Performance Root Cause</title>
      <description>What are your first steps when you hear one of your SQL Servers is having a performance problem? In this demo-driven session, we will discuss key DMVs that can provide us data quickly. We will examine a number of example queries that can lead us to a quick root cause analysis in a number of different situations. This session will be kept at a very functional level, and should be accessible for anyone interested in SQL Server performance.</description>
