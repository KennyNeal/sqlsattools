      <title>Level Up: Data Modeling for the Power BI Rockstar</title>
      <description>In the world of Power BI, data modeling is what separates the Rockstars from the Rookies. Join me to learn how dimensional modeling - a concept developed 20+ years ago - continues to be the best approach for delivering self-service BI to the masses.

Not only will good data modeling result in better Power BI solutions that support a wider range of reporting requirements, but they will also be easier for the business users to understand and work with. 

In this session, you'll learn how to create flexible data models that can be expanded upon over time, unlock the power of the date table, and a variety of DAX patterns supporting common but complex business logic.
 
If your Power BI solutions typically contain a single table, if you're frequently banging your head against the wall trying to figure out how to write a DAX calculation, or if you've never heard the term "dimensional model" or "star-schema", this session is for you.</description>

      <title>Keeping Your Data Secure In Azure While Automatically Refreshing Power BI Datasets</title>
      <description>Your company has completed its data migration to Azure and now various teams are wanting to build, share and view Power BI reports and dashboards using the data.  Additionally, the access to the data has been limited to a specific list of applications and users but not to Power BI.

So how do you support the automatic data refresh of the data within Power BI and still ensure that the security of your company's data is not compromised?

This advanced Power BI session presents several techniques that can be used to maintain (and sometimes enhance) the security of your company's data while ensuring that Power BI datasets are regularly refreshed.</description>

      <title>Microsoft AutoML the Next Generation of Machine Learning</title>
      <description>Automated machine learning simplifies the traditional machine learning process () by creating models with applying hyperparameter settings, and different algorithms.

      <title>Power BI Embedded for Fun and Profit</title>
      <description>You COULD hire a front end developer to build data visualizations for your app. You COULD use "Publish to Web" to expose your sensitive data to anyone who gets a hold of the link. You COULD even force your users to leave what they were working on and tab over to the Power BI service to look at the data relevant to their current task.

None of that is fun, and it certainly isn't the most efficient use of time or funds. Fortunately, Power BI embedded is coming to your rescue. You can use the visualizations you've already built, keep the security you've already put in place, and allow your users to view contextual data in your applications-- right where they need it. You'll learn how embedding works within the Power BI service and how to create a successful embedded deployment.</description>

      <title>Managing ETL Change Using BIMLScript</title>
      <description>Change is constant, especially with source files. Health care claims data files change at least yearly. You develop an SSIS package to load the source file. You meticulously identify each of the columns and map them to the targets. Your package runs fine for months. Then the file format changes. Again, you tediously select each column, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to simply document the structure of the file, the file's metadata, and generate the SSIS from that metadata? Your users demand the documentation anyway. If the file changes, you simply change the metadata. 

To demonstrate such an approach, I import some US census data. I create the SSIS package using BIMLScript and metadata. When the format changes, I change the metadata and generate a whole new package. And if your whole ETL approach changes to say Azure Data Factory? I will demonstrate how to generate an Azure Data Factory pipeline from the same metadata.</description>

      <title>Replace Hundreds of Fragmented SSRS Reports with Integrated Dashboards in Weeks</title>
      <description>Has your organization accumulated a ton of reports that are crucial, yet fragmented and difficult to maintain? This session deals with the challenge of documenting those disconnected reports and replacing them with integrated dashboards. We will also discuss the trade offs of different data integration architecture options such as data lakes, dimensional models, real time solutions like data virtualization, and cloud based solutions. 

In this session, we will explore:
- Different industry solutions to document your existing SSRS reports and SSAS cubes to identify all the columns used in source tables/objects.
- Interrogating the database objects (views, stored  procedures, etc.) to decipher the ETL mappings and transformations and present this in a human readable format of data lineage with business rules applied to the source system.
- Grouping these reports into sets to be consolidated in a few dashboard
- Different solutions to accommodate the desired data integration architecture</description>

      <description>Microsoft Power BI, Flow, and PowerApps are powerful cloud tools that can take your on-premises data to new heights. Using your data where it is now gives you the ability to invest in improving processes, instead of focusing on a data migration strategy.

In this session, we will discover the benefits of using the cloud tools, how those benefits translate to being on-prem, and how we can use the data in Office 365 as well. We will setup a data gateway, connect to on-prem data sources, and use that data in Office 365 and SharePoint Server.</description>

      <title>Speed up your data models using Azure Analysis Services</title>
      <description>Azure Analysis Services is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that hosts Tabular Models in the cloud. The same capabilities with on-premise SSAS Tabular Models are applied to this new version. Benefits to running Azure AS is the ability to scale up\down, pause, and resume on demand. In this session we will build a semantic data model, migrate to Azure, and visualize using Power BI. If you are running Tabular Models that are compatibility level 1200 and higher this session will show you how quick and easy it is to migrate to Azure.</description>

      <title>Power BI Dataset Tuning</title>
      <description>Most Power BI reports rely on a small dataset. And due to a lighting fast data engine most data model mistakes are shadowed by the speed of the service. When the dataset gets bigger then best data modeling practices are required. The trick here is Power BI data engine is not relational and therefore most data modeling techniques either don’t apply or don’t deliver. In this session we will go over how to model and measure performance for larger Power BI datasets.</description>
