      <title>Encrypting Data Within SQL Server</title>
      <description>Data breaches abound! Do you want to keep your company out of the headlines? What are some of the data privacy laws affecting you? How will encrypting data affect your database performance? What data fields should you encrypt? What else can you do to protect your sensitive data? 

In this session, we will review each option to encrypt data within SQL Server, Transparent Data Encryption, Cell Level Encryption, and Always Encrypted. While we look at the encryption options, we will review both on-premise and cloud offerings. This session will deep dive into setting up Always Encrypted encryption and share experiences implementing the encryption. Also, let’s learn how to classify data which should be protected and how to audit sensitive data usage. 

You will leave this session with a deeper understanding about SQL Server encryption options and how encryption can affect your performance. Also, you will gather information on how to fully protect and review your sensitive data usage.</description>

      <title>That's So Metadata: Discover Your Database From The Inside</title>
      <description>Have you ever needed to learn a new database design and don't know where to begin? Or are trying to find out why a query doesn't perform well?  Or need to provide security information to auditors or your security team?

SQL Server has numerous metadata facilities available to help you with these tasks and more. Functions, dynamic management views, and system stored procedures can illuminate details from a single column up through an entire SQL Server instance. We will demonstrate metadata techniques to help you:

- Document your database schema objects such as procedures, functions, tables, columns and indexes
- Investigate performance and look for bottlenecks and tuning opportunities
- Discover metadata to administer your databases backups, index maintenance, and security
- Apply your own metadata using extended properties

We will also cover the official Microsoft documentation on these features and other resources on how to use them.</description>

      <description>DevOps automation can be intriguing to learn and overwhelming to implement. This session will take a real life use case of a multi-tier and complex environments, with various stake holders to a successful conclusion.  Unlike a session on concepts, this session surrounds itself with a real-life situation and how automation was used with DevOps practices to build a solution.
The session will demonstrate the reasons to automate, along with the steps required to make it possible, offering insight into concepts that are often too vague to employ. The attendee will see multi-platform and cloud tool demonstrations on how to take the DevOps methodology and continuous delivery to actuality in their own projects, no matter if small or large.</description>

      <title>Common Data Model - Our new buddy for Data Governance</title>
      <description>Common Data Model as the foundation of Power BI Dataflows and as part of the Open Data Initiative with SAP and Adobe, seems to be a pretty good move from Microsoft. We want to take a closer look to this approach. In this session we show how the Common Data Model will allow you to combine Self-Service ETL and Corporate Data Engineering. We will show you how Power BI and more specialised tools like ADF, DataBricks etc. can work together on the Azure Data Lake with one common model. We than extend this and show, what opportunities this standard brings to you, when we unleash the possibilities you have on managing Data Quality and Governance. We also will have a look in how you integrate CDM in a DataOps  Methodology.</description>

      <title>The Jupyterian Snake Invasion: Intro to Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Azure and Beyond [VIDEO]</title>
      <description>Python and Jupyter Notebooks have become popular with data professionals and cloud platforms such as Azure and Google. With applications in data exploration, analysis, model training, visualization, and data sharing, they've transformed how data professionals work. In conjunction with the growth of these tools, data workflows are also utilizing cloud resources for easier collaboration, access to powerful hardware, and distributed storage/computation. Join us in this interactive session for an intro to Jupyter Notebooks and Python, where they came from, when you should use them and how they are being used on the cloud today. We will walk through a basic data project using some core data packages in Python to explore a dataset and see these tools in action. By the end of this session you will be ready to join the Jupyterian Snake Invasion in data questing!

To get a head start with Jupyter, explore your first notebook with Azure notebooks:

      <title>Data Privacy and Data Security in a Data-Driven world</title>
      <description>New advances in technology coupled with the rate of change in the data-driven world are placing the issue of Privacy and Ethics at the forefront of public consciousness – forcing a discussion around the ethical use of data within business and the role that each data professional must play in ensuring that the highest standards are reached, maintained, and constantly evaluated. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial Intelligence, and big data processing are providing new business opportunities that must also account for privacy and ethics issues while maintaining a balance with compliance, security, and integrity of data. 
But what are the issues that individual data professionals should be aware of to avoid reputational damage to their companies and themselves? And what are the tools that can help them in their endeavors? 

This session will take a close look at some of these challenges and the tools that are available to help mitigate these issues and risks.</description>

      <title>Reporting Services Tips, Tricks, Templates and Considerations</title>
      <description>This session is an overview of some of the features and capabilities of Reporting Services.  In it you will see a variety of reports styles and template considerations and get an understanding of the power of Linked Reports and Shared Data Sets along with a brief look at some of the Enterprise Edition capabilities with KPIs and Mobile Reports. 
We will also cover how to use the data in the ReportServer database to determine which reports are being utilized and determine which reports to migrate to a new implementation of SSRS.  Come see how you can use PowerShell to extract the reports and datasets from the database in order to build a new solution for deployment to a new server.

Experience managing SSRS and ideally an understanding of the ReportServer database is useful but not required in order to benefit from this session.</description>

      <title>Enterprise Power BI - Development Lifecycle [VIDEO]</title>
      <description>When your development team is up to a certain size and often no matter what size it is you want to start following best development practices. These include things like source control, multiple environments, deployment processes and governance.

As Power BI content is developed using Power BI Desktop and not Visual Studio as most Microsoft BI solutions are these things can get tricky. 

In this session we will look at what Power BI has to offer when it comes to development lifecycle. We will look at the different options available to the developer when it comes to source control, dev, test and production and deployment of Power BI content. We will then look at the different options when it comes to distribution of content to the end user. Lastly, we will look at governance and see how it is possible to secure the content and audit the usage of Power BI.</description>

      <title>Certificates and EXECUTE AS - Putting Permissions Inside Stored Procedures</title>
      <description>The basic mechanism when we want to give users access to data or actions in SQL Server in a controlled way through stored procedure is ownership chaining. This is something we use everyday as SQL workers, although we may not be aware of it. Every once in a while, we run into situations where it seems that it is not sufficient to put a statement in a stored procedure, but that users need to be granted explicit permissions – something we may not always be comfortable with, because that would permit the users to do things we do not want them to be able to.

There are two additional mechanisms in SQL Server we can employ in these situations: certificate signing and the EXECUTE AS clause. In this session I will start by exploring how ownership chaining works and its limitations. I will then proceed to explore the other two options and I will particularly focus on certificate signing, as this is the preferred method. At first it may seem overly complex, but I will show how it easily can be automated. EXECUTE AS may seem simpler, but I will point out potential problems with it, not the least if you try to use it on server level and consider to set the database as TRUSTWORTHY.

This session is directed towards both developers and DBAs, as this session deals with problems you may face in either roles.</description>

      <title>Grabbing the brass ring: tools for better self-advocacy in the tech workplace</title>
      <description>Have you ever felt passed up for a promotion or a stretch assignment because you identify as a woman, non-binary and/or as BIPOC (black, indigenous, or a person of color)? Have you ever had a chance to reach for the proverbial brass ring but did not or was prevented from doing so? 
Many workplaces endeavor to create an inclusive and equitable workplace but end up missing the mark by perpetuating systemic biases that impact the ability for folks to realize their fullest career potential, or even get access to the game at all. 
Join a panel of prolific speakers from PDX Women In Tech who will address topics like what to do when gender and/or race set the tone for the environment, and what to do when leadership doesn’t recognize an opportunity to promote equity. 
Audience (all are welcome) will be able to learn new ways to approach self-advocacy (or, in the case of allies, advocacy) and tips and techniques to further the conversation around equity and inclusion in their workplace.</description>

      <title>Enterprise Row Level Security in SQL Server and Power BI  [VIDEO]</title>
      <description>The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/2017/2019 and Azure SQL DB/DW with predicate based RLS and in Power BI, as well. This session will show how organizational  asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/2017, Azure SQL Database and Power BI without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations. 

Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS.</description>

      <title>Theory Driven Data Science: Cyber-security Improvement using SQL, R and machine learning [Video]</title>
      <description>Data science seeks to uncover actionable data relationships  to solve pressing organizational needs e.g. improved cyber security behavior, and this talk presents three steps for doing just that. The aim  is an exemplary theory driven approach to data evidence of better preparedness against cybersecurity threats. We will present a theory of cybersecurity behavior and how data was collected from training participants then stored in SQL server for analysis in R with a ML classifier. The ML random forest classifier implemented in R is used to analyze survey responses to theoretically-inspired questions. It creates a preferred multi-model integration that can be reused on future data to identify the individuals less likely to participate in the security training who may also be a higher security risk. The talk concludes by summarizing the three tips for actionable data science projects covered here. A short video will preview for SQL Saturday attendees.</description>

      <title>Windowing Functions: Shedding some light</title>
      <description>One of the simplest ways to enhance the value of the information we provide is to add context. Supplementing each data point with information from a larger data set is a common way of adding this context. In T-SQL, we achieve this by using Windowing Functions. 

In this demo-heavy session, we will walk through the uses of Windowing Functions, from simple row orders to more complicated calculations like rolling averages. We'll explore each keyword in turn, building more sophisticated functions as we do. Each concept is illustrated in a visual, and T-SQL example so it is clearly understood.

So whether it's tracking a value against the previous row, creating running totals, or a rolling sum, when you walk out of this session, you'll be able to write a windowing function to make it happen.</description>

      <title>CozyRoc: Dynamic Data Flows in SSIS Without Programming</title>
      <description>This session is an introduction to the unique functionality offered by COZYROC to create integration packages that dynamically map columns at runtime. The standard SSIS Data Flow Task can only use static metadata which is defined when the package is initially designed. The mapping of columns is configured and remains unchanged until the package is re-opened and design changes are made, thus costing maintenance time and effort. Data Flow Task Plus extends the capabilities of the standard Microsoft Data Flow task in that it allows you to set up dynamic data flows, thus eliminating maintenance time and effort. Changes to tables and columns are automatically incorporated at run time without the need to change and redeploy the package. Columns and fields are mapped automatically at run time. Furthermore, the initial design time and effort may be greatly reduced when dealing with huge amounts of data in a large number of files and/or databases.</description>

      <title>Get Faster Queries with Better Statistics Management</title>
      <description>Statistics are key to the selection of a good execution play. But statistics aren’t perfect, and they often require management over and above what the default SQL Server configurations supply.
In this session we’ll look into why statistics, and specifically the histogram, are so important to good query performance. We’ll see how they’re not perfect, and how that can result in an occasional bad execution plan (slow query). I’ll also present a few methods to resolve those statistics-caused performance issues. Of course there will be plenty of examples.</description>

      <title>Continuous Intelligence... Is it all about automation?</title>
      <description>Continuous Intelligence is commonly used to describe approaches to constantly analyze data by applying machine-learning algorithms. But you can also understand it to be a combination of the terms of Continuous Integration and Business Intelligence. 
Support for BI projects in CI has been a field for improvement in even the near past. But why was that?
BI offers some special challenges for CI processes that we want to discuss during this session.</description>

      <title>What is DevOps and Why Should DBAs Care? [VIDEO]</title>
      <description>You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? 
Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better.</description>

      <title>VMWare - Virtualizing SQL Server on vSphere</title>
      <description>For most DBAs virtualization is no longer a matter of "If" but "When". This means it is critical for DBAs to understand how this technology works and how we can ensure we get the most performance and scalability out of it. In this session we will look at some of the best practices and gotchas when Designing Standalone and Highly Available SQL deployments in a vSphere environment. We'll also cover how to troubleshoot performance issues when they arise.</description>

      <title>The SQL Server Performance Tasting Menu</title>
      <description>You’re a DBA or Developer, and you’ve been using SQL Server for a few years.

You know there are different ways to make queries faster, but you’re not sure when to use them.

I’m Erik Darling, and I’ll be your sommelier for the evening.

Over several courses of delicious demos, I’ll show you the types of performance problems different tuning techniques pair well with, and which ones to avoid.

When we’re done, you’ll understand exactly what patterns to look for when you’re troubleshooting slow queries, and how to approach them.

You’ll have the secret recipe for gourmet queries.</description>

      <title>Defining What's Normal -- The Basics of Database Normalization</title>
      <description>Determining how to efficiently design database structures for a given application has always relied on the same old answer: "It depends!" So, how do you determine what level of normalization your data requires?  This session will review the principles of data normalization, show the impact that normalization can have on performance and data integrity, and just as importantly, show you when it's OK to break the rules and denormalize.  We will cover some case situations where it's better not to be normal!</description>
