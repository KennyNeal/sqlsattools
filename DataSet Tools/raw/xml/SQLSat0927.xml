      <title>Choose Your Own Adventure - Performance Edition</title>
      <description>Remember those "choose your own adventure" books from when we were younger? Yep, that's what we're doing in this session.

We're going to start with a poorly performing query and choose which route we're going to take to see if we can make it better.

You don't need any previous experience in performance tuning for this session, we'll briefly cover each topic as it's chosen.

Potential topics include;
- Indexes
- Query Design
- Settings that might affect performance
- Scalar Functions
- SARGability
- Temp Tables

We'll be voting on where we go at each step to see where our journey takes us.

In the session we'll cover each topic a little but I will also provide a more in-depth explanation of everything we go through after the session if you want to learn more.</description>

      <title>When Things go Wrong - Error Handling in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Most modern programming environments offers exception handling in some form, and SQL Server provides the popular TRY-CATCH concept. However, error handling in SQL Server is not as straightforward as one may wish, but it is marred with inconsistencies and surprises. This session starts off by displaying the some of the surprises you can encounter, both when you use TRY-CATCH and when you don't.

The session presents a recipe for writing CATCH block where focus is on keeping things simple and you will learn why it is not a good idea to make your error handling "fancy", although it may seem to be a good idea in theory. The session also covers a few things to think of on client level.

Once we have learnt how to handle unanticipated errors, we can start to look at how to handle errors we know can occur and in which case we want to take an alternate action. We will also learn how to - and if - to implement retries on deadlocks.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Terraform, Infrastructure as Code</title>
      <description>With ever increasing complexity in data platform and application solutions, it is becoming ever more important to take people out of the loop when it comes to system provisioning. Infrastructure as code is the way forward with Azure Resource Manager Templares, Google Deployment Manager, or AWS Cloud Formation.

This is where Terraform from Hashicorp can step in, one solution that has a provider model that will interact with Azure, AWS, Google, and others. Meaning that you only need to learn one syntax. Add that to the automation potential and now we have something that can really help get us down the road to infratructure as code.

This session will take an introductory look at how infrastructure can be defined as code and be shipped to standardise the deployment process and minimise the chance of mistakes creeping in when deployed by different memebers of Development or Operations.</description>

      <title>Database Adventure</title>
      <description>Aimed mostly at administration and based on real life scenarios, this popular audience interactive session we will go through some scenarios DBA's might encounter whilst dealing with SQL Server databases and you will be provided with some options about what to do. 

Members of the audience can then select from the options provided and we will follow that path and see what the outcome is from there. Similar to a role-playing game.

Each selection will have a different outcome, and along the way you will probably learn some new things.

As some of you may have seen on the blog www.KevinRChant.com I've already had dealing with SQL Server 2019. Therefore, this session has been updated to include SQL Server 2019 content.</description>

      <title>Rebooting your SME Data Analysis Strategy</title>
      <description>For many businesses out there, adopting a progressive data analysis strategy is the domain of the big players. You need a budget, you need investment and with only a small number of users, the costs are off-putting. Hard to justify some costs when your user base may only be a few or a few dozen users. This is no longer the case with the PowerBI Platform. 

This session is based on real-life customer implementations where they were taken away from their Excel and Microsoft Access and LOB based reporting solutions towards the Power Platform. We show how we started with Power BI and evolved into a comprehensive solution that combines SharePoint Online with PowerBI to provide an end to end reporting solution. Further phases of these project introduced Power Apps and Flow to further enhance the analytical capabilities of the company.</description>

      <title>Driven by the 9s - I need a highly available Microsoft Data Platform – what features should I use?</title>
      <description>Microsoft’s data platform and SQL Server comes with a plethora of High Availability features. Some of these features can work hand-in glove with each other to allow you to configure your SQL Servers to be both Highly-Available and recoverable in the event of the worst happening. 

If you are driven by the '9s', have strict SLAs and up time is key to you and your business, then combining SQL Server’s high availability features is something you should consider. 

In this session we will look at how we can combine SQL Server Availability Groups and SQL Server Failover cluster instances to keep our servers both highly available and maintain a secondary disaster recovery.</description>

      <title>Shadow prediction: SQL spatial data types and astronomy well mixed</title>
      <description>Can you use GEOGRAPHY data types to calculate and display celestial phenomena and does it make sense? 
It needs some math and the willingness to use SQL objects for purposes, they haven’t been designed for.
This session is a (hopefully) entertaining exercise to combine scarcely used data types with a bit of astronomy and math to calculate and visualize the relationship between sun and wind turbines (i.e. moving shadows that may annoy the neighbors) solely by using SQL Management Studio.
Only GEOGRAPHY data type will be used to show the richness and beauty of its functionality. 
 Apart from 2-3 formulas everything will be handled in SQL.</description>

      <title>Creating ETL/ELT Data Flows for the Modern Data Warehouse</title>
      <description>One major challenge in the age of "Big Data" is keeping up with the volume and velocity of data with respect to moving it to the Data Warehouse. In this session, attendees will learn about Microsoft's answer to this problem; Azure Data Factory (ADF), and specifically, Mapping Data Flows. ADF Mapping Data Flows enables data engineers to construct, execute, and monitor data pipelines, based on the highly scalable Azure Databricks Spark Engine, with little to no code.

This session will be very demo-heavy, with demonstrations of effective patterns and practices that have been deployed by some of Microsoft's largest customers throughout the world.</description>

That's it, data scientists have left the house! Behind them, some scripts written in Python or R, thousands of CSV files, three sheets and two whiteboards of mathematical equations, many PowerPoint presentations and a clear instruction from the CEO: go to production ASAP! Unfortunately, no trace of a deployment procedure. Hopefully, this session, will explain how to industrialize data scientists' scripts. How to import and refactor code written in Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code, How to put in place the best practices of DevOps and apply them to Machine Learning with Azure Pipelines and some other tips and tricks for a successful go-live.</description>

      <title>10 Steps Towards Global Data Compliance</title>
      <description>Data compliance in the modern technology landscape feels like a constantly moving target as more and different laws, rules and regulations are passed locally, nationally and internationally. The days when only some organizations or certain countries had to worry about data compliance are gone. It’s everyone’s problem.

However, it is possible to define a core set of processes that will help to enable your ability to assist your business, or government agency, in meeting these compliance requirements. This session will walk you through the 10 steps you need to implement in order to move your organization towards full compliance with any, or all, of the regulations we all now face. From identifying where your data lives to monitoring for compliance and all the steps in between, you can meet this challenge.</description>

      <description>By combining the power of Power BI data alerts with the hundreds of actions available for Flow, we’re making it easier than ever to go from insight to deep, meaningful action.

Microsoft Flow is a SaaS offering for automating workflows across the growing number of applications and services that business users rely on. You can set up Flows to take care of the important, repeating tasks that take place daily in your organization. For example, you can create a Flow to text you via SMS when your manager sends you an e-mail marked as  “high importance.” Or, automatically create a to-do item in Wunderlist when a customer e-mails your support line.</description>

      <title>DevOps 101 for Data Folks</title>
      <description>DevOps has fundamentally changed the way we manage IT. Those practicing DevOps well aren't just outpacing their competitors, they are annihilating them. DevOps brings a whole host of new practices, tools and buzzwords. It has made some roles and  tasks redundant, while new opportunities have been created.

We all need to learn to survive in this new reality.

In this session we'll cut through the hype and look at the key concepts and findings from the Puppet State of DevOps Reports,  The DevOps Handbook and Microsoft's work in this space.

We will finish with an overview of an Azure DevOps Services project that automatically tests and deploys the code from a SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) project in a public GitHub repo.</description>

      <title>Persistence is Futile - Implementing Delayed Durability in SQL Server</title>
      <description>The concurrency model of most Relational Database Systems are defined by the ACID properties but as they aim for ever increasing transactional throughput, those rules are bent, ignored, or even broken.

In this session, we will investigate how SQL Server implements transactional durability in order to understand how Delayed Durability bends the rules to remove transactional bottlenecks and achieve improved throughput. We will take a look at how this can be used to compliment In-Memory OLTP performance, and how it might impact or compromise other things.

      <description>At some point in time, whether in the past or in the future, we will experience being in a situation where there is a major outage or problem that needs to be dealt with. But how can we ensure that it does not decend into chaos and make the problem worse?

Join me as I share a number of tips and tricks about how to take control of the situation. We will cover establishing a control structure, commuincations, and documentation. All of which when done well can result in a calm and controlled resolution and faciliate root cause analysis. We will also look at ways to prepare for such situations and how you can lay the groundwork so that if something does go wrong you are ready for it.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for building a Data Lake with Azure Databricks</title>
      <description>Databricks is a Unified Analytics Platform making it easier than ever to do big data analytics on cloud. However, there are a lot of things you need to know and take into account before diving head first into a Data Lake. This session is intended for architects and developers who are looking to build a massive scale data storing and processing solution. I will go through the Best Practices for the purpose. In addition, I will demonstrate how to unify real-time and batch processing using Azure Databricks. As a result, you should feel comfortable building your own Data Lake for your big data processing needs.</description>
