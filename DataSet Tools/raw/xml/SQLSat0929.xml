      <description>I started my IT journey 20+ years ago with native programming in C, C++ and Visual Basic. I found myself gravitating towards back end and databases made me comfortable, knowing what's in store, data being captured. The information that data reveals, modeling data to suit consumption, slicing and dicing to reveal the state of a business and visualization to tell a story is very enjoyable for me.
As a consultant, I enjoy the vareity of business domains, business problems to solve and the challenge of devising a solution within constraints of client limitations or technology .</description>

      <description>Time-Intelligence refers to doing BI calculations across periods of time (usually dates), and is the most common type of analysis in business reporting. Month-to-Date (MTD), Year-to-Date (YTD), Prior-Month (PM), Prior-Year (PY), Month-over-Month (MoM), Year-over-Year (YoY) are all examples of Time-Intelligence calculations. There are many approaches to implementing time-intelligence into your Power BI solutions, including the use of built-in date tables and time-intelligence functions. In this session, we'll explore several of these approaches and the associated tradeoffs. We'll also learn about the importance of a good date table, what attributes it should include, and how it can be leveraged to simplify more complex time-intelligence calculations. We'll also take the first step in mastering DAX by familiarizing ourselves with the CALCULATE function.</description>

      <title>A Data Journey for an Analytics Company</title>
      <description>Often the most challenging aspect of becoming a data-driven organization is determining where to start. Case in point: Icimo Analytics. As a company that transforms data into meaningful business value, we were neglecting our own data journey. Externally, we were transforming organizations into lean data machines while internally, we were still relying heavily on spreadsheets, multiple platforms and disparate systems. Turning our expertise inward, we designed dynamic dashboards fueled by Tableau and Alteryx to see a one-stop holistic view of our entire business. The end result? Each employee is strategically positioned to see, understand and make data-driven informed decisions driving value and setting the foundation for lasting growth and success.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting PowerBI Performance Problems</title>
      <description>Power BI is a great tool for mashing up and visualizing data. If you are not careful though, you end up with visuals that take too long to load and a PBIX that exhausts available memory.  This session shows you how to maintain the crisp performance and stunning compression that you want in every data model.

 To help with the optimization effort, Dan will demonstrate common tools for troubleshooting Power BI performance issues. He will also review some common mistakes that drain the life from models and provide ways to avoid these pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Launching a Data Science Project:  Cleaning is Half the Battle</title>
      <description>There's an old adage in software development: Garbage In, Garbage Out. This adage certainly applies to data science projects: if you simply throw raw data at models, you will end up with garbage results. In this session, we will build an understanding of just what it takes to implement a data science project whose results are not garbage. We will the Microsoft Team Data Science Process as our model for project implementation, learning what each step of the process entails. To motivate this walkthrough, we will see what we can learn from a survey of data professionals' salaries.</description>

      <title>Taking Your Dashboard From Good To Great</title>
      <description>Putting together an initial dashboard can have its own challenges. However, what does it take to go from a dashboard that meets requirements to one that shines and dazzles?

This talk will look at best practices for which types of visuals to use, as well as which should be averted and why.  We will dig into things like colors to avoid, good charts and bad charts, and ways to maximize the visual real estate.</description>

      <title>Classification With Naive Bayes</title>
      <description>The Naïve Bayes series of algorithms are some of the simplest classification algorithms, but they tend to offer reasonably good results very quickly for a number of problems, including Natural Language Processing problems such as spam classification, as well as more classical feature-driven classification.  In this talk, we will look at the math behind Naïve Bayes classification, solving problems by hand before looking at a package in R which solves the problem for us.  By the end of this talk, you should be able to apply Naïve Bayes to existing problems.  No experience with statistics is required, although there will be a small amount of math.</description>
