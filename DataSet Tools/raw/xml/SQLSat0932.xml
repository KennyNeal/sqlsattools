      <title>Performance Tuning with SQLDiag, the best free tool you never knew you had.</title>
      <description>Have you ever had the need to tune the performance of a SQL Server workload and got fed up with trying to line up all the data capture you need to get a picture of what is going on? What if I said that you have had a tool all along that can do this?

SQLDiag installs with SQL Server and is capable of coordinating the capture of trace data, perfmon data, and log files for you. Sounds great, "how do I use it?" I hear you ask.

In this session we will look at how to setup and run a data capture against SQL Server. We will then look at how to process the captured data into a format that we can use to troubleshoot performance problems. I will also showcase a number of additional tools such as Diag Manager, PAL, and Relog to help make sense of the data captured.

By the end of this session you will be in a position to start using SQLDiag to perform data catpure and have the toolset to process it to solve performance problems with your SQL Server systems.</description>

      <title>Data Science in Power BI Desktop</title>
      <description>Two of the most popular modern topics are data science and Power BI. The nice thing is that you can easily combine both of them by including data science analyses in Power BI. You can do this in numerous ways. Many Power BI visualizations already include the Analytics tab with plethora of intermediate-level analytical functions available. For example, you can add a trend line and many other lines to the Scatter chart. You can use R and / or Python script sources. You can do the whole analysis in R or Python, and then visualize the results in Power BI. You can also use the good old SSAS Multidimensional Data Mining as the source. You can include Azure ML predictions in a Power BI model. With R and Python visuals, you can add the impressive visualizations from these two languages in a Power BI report and dashboard. You can also use R and Python in Power Query for advanced data manipulation. There are also many custom visuals that include data science analyses. This session introduces all</description>

      <title>Leverage Power BI automation using APIs and Flow</title>
      <description>Power BI is a cloud-based service; it means that it comes along with a standard set of APIs that provides access to its internal resources such as reports, datasets, rows.   
Using APIs gives more flexibility and allows to build custom dashboard applications either for administering or query the service.  
And if you combine the power of APIs with Microsoft Flow, you can automate some background processes such as adding users, granting rights, update or refresh datasets, ... 
The session is demo only. A complete walk-through to the process, will show you how to register an app, create a custom connector and leverage Power BI API actions by triggering a Microsoft Flow object.</description>

      <title>FILETABLEs: What They Are and How to Use Them</title>
      <description>Have you ever had the need to access documents in your database as if they were files in the file system? SQL Server 2012 introduced a brand new method for managing large data objects (BLOBs) in a database. FILETABLEs provide access to data using Transact-SQL - just like any other table inside the database, while at the same time also provide access to the data using the operating system File I/O API - i.e. just like any other folder in the file system. In this session you will learn how to upgrade your document management solutions by migrating your large data to FILETABLEs. The session covers two most typical migration scenarios: migrating from a distributed data store, where files are stored outside the database, and from a homogeneous data store, where all the data is stored inside the database.</description>

      <title>Building a modern data warehouse and BI solution in Microsoft cloud</title>
      <description>Data warehouse and BI market is evolving rapidly with the appearance of new cloud born technologies. We might assume, that moving an existing Microsoft based DWH to the cloud is an easy step, but when we dig a little bit deeper, we will see, there are many-many new technological choices and aspects on how to modernize an existing dwh/bi system in the cloud. Not to mention if we start everything from scratch in a new project designed specifically to the cloud to utilize cloud flexibility and innovation as much as possible. 
Which ETL tool should I use? Data factory v2 with SSIS and BIML, or Azure Databricks powered Dataflows? Or Power BI Dataflow? Which is the right decision to run OLAP workloads? Azure AS? Or simply Power BI? When do I need Azure SQL DWH?
In the last couple years I helped many customers to modernize their DWH landscape partially or fully in the cloud and during my presentation I will share my findings and recipes for the most common situation I met. You will have fun:)</description>

      <title>Logging Actual execution plans in SQL 2017 and 2019</title>
      <description>Actual execution plan gives us most comprehensive info for tuning a query, much more than estimated plan.
Now it also includes wait statistics, logical reads, and actual row numbers for that execution.
But there is a catch - it is traditionally very expensive to track plans for all executions, even if we filter for only slow ones.
We will see how new versions of SQL Server evolved to get us actual plans without sacrificing performance.
Let me introduce you to "Lightweight profiling" you can have enabled all the time on your server, with close to zero impact.</description>

      <title>Implementing security in Azure Data Platform Solutions</title>
      <description>As computing environments is moving customer-controlled on premises data centers to cloud data centers, the responsibility of security also shifts. Security is nowadays a concern shared by cloud providers, organizations and individuals. For every solution, it's important to understand what's solution provider responsibility and what's Azure's responsibility.

In this presentation, attendees will see how Azure provides a multi-layered security model to protect customer data. I will show how security can range from setting up secure networks and access keys, to defining permission and to monitoring with Advanced Threat Detection across a range of data stores.</description>

Those are the tools you use on SQL Server on-prem to diagnose long running queries and server weaknesses. You use more or less the same tools on Azure SQL, but there are differences: permissions, database-specific views, XEvents ring buffer reading. In this session, we will address specific queries and views, and diagnosis steps specific to Azure SQL.</description>

      <title>Query Folding in Power BI</title>
      <description>Power Query allows you to extract and transform data from a variety of data sources. Have you ever experienced that the importing of data is slower than you expected? In most of those cases, query folding is not happening fully optimized.
Query folding is important because it offloads data transformations to the source, instead of performing them in Power BI.
Attend this session to learn how to ensure that you get all the performance improvements possible within your reports! As a bonus, you will also learn in which cases query folding is not your best friend.</description>

      <title>Transact-SQL Performance Tips</title>
      <description>U ovoj populističkoj sesiji razmatraćemo kako način na koji je napisan upit može da dovede do sporog izvršenja uprkos povoljnom izvršnom okruženju (postoje dobri indeksi, server je rasterećen, nema mnogo konkurentnih sesija...)  i onemogući SQL Server da ga izvrši koristeći optimalni execution plan. 

Pokrićemo tipične greške koje programeri tom prilikom prave zbog nedovoljnog poznavanja funkcionisanja database engina.

Razume se, podelićemo savete u vezi sa pisanjem upita koji će svakako pomoći da se izbegnu tipične i najčešće greške u svakodnevnom radu sa SQL Serverom, a i elaboriraćemo šta bi to svaki programer trebalo da zna o SQL Serveru.
