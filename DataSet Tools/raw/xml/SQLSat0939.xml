      <description>I am an independent consultant based in the UK, specializing in all things Excel, especially delivering BI within Excel. 

I came to appreciate the power and versatility of Excel as an enterprise tool in the mid-90s when managing the delivery of a data warehouse project. 

Now a freelance consultant, I specialize in Excel automation and BI delivered via Excel. An 11 year veteran of Microsoft#39;s MVP program, my life mission is to persuade small and medium corporates that data analysis and BI is important to them too, and that Power BI can help then find that information, in a straight-forward and cost-effective manner.</description>

      <title>More Common Than You Think: Mental Illness in Tech</title>
      <description>Mental illness is more common than you think.  One in four Americans suffers from a mental illness each year.  In the tech community, this is often not talked about.  Many times, people feel alone and isolated in the tech community with us mostly being introverted people.  It is time to start talking about mental illness out in the open and honestly about how it affects us and those around us.

In this session, we will talk about what mental illness is and what it is not.  How my mental illness has affected me.  How it effects the tech industry.  How mental illness can affect you and how you can tell if you are starting to have issues.  What to say and what not to say to people you know that are affected by mental illness.  Finally, how to get help and where reach out for help.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Data Science and Databricks</title>
      <description>Databricks is a very popular environment for developing data science solutions.  More and more companies are interested in Databricks as it is very simple to set up and contains a collaborative workspace for working with a team of people. In this session you will see how to create Machine Learning Solutions with multiple workflows starting with ETL, to data exploration, model experimentation, and lastly to a production release of a data science solution. 

Today, more and more development is performed on very large datasets. Attendees will learn how to use Apache Spark, which is part of Databricks, to rapidly analyze lots of data.  Learn how to use Databricks to reduces operational complexity to create solutions which can be scaled up or down depending on the amount of data needed to process without having to change the underlying code. 
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Apache Spark are the technologies used to create solutions within this session.  No experience is required.

      <title>A metadata approach to fixed width files</title>
      <description>Face it, using SSIS to work with fixed width flat files is a pain.  The SSIS interface has you clicking around to mark each column. Then you use another interface to set each columns data types, etc.  And when you are done, you still need to document the file structure for your users.  What if you could simply document the file structure and then generate the ETL from the document?
To demonstrate such an approach, I build an Excel file describing US census data that has more than 300 columns of fixed width data.  After demonstrating how this file communicates to business users, I will generate an SSIS package from that metadata using BIML Script.  Then I will also look at how you can generate a SQL Server bulk insert format file from the same metadata.  A small amount of C# code can generate quite a large extract.</description>

      <title>Do I Need To M?</title>
      <description>Power Query is an powerful tool enabling the data analyst in creating usable data. It is one product that can truly claim to be user friendly, as so much of the functionality is available within the UI.

But, and there is always a but, sometimes you need to do things that are just not available through the UI. This is where you need to get down and get dirty, and manage the M code directly (M being the language that drives Power Query).

This session is all about the value of developing skills in M. Starting with a brief intro to M and some references to resources to help develop those skills further, we will then demonstrate a number of things you can do by directly coding in M, things that are not as simple or just can't be done through the UI.

The session will be using Power Query in Excel as Excel is still the most used BI delivery tool, but all of the techniques and code also apply to Power BI.</description>

      <title>Change Tracking: A Near Bullet-Proof ETL Synchronization Control</title>
      <description>Change Tracking came out with SQL Server 2008, but SS2012 almost eclipsed it with Change Data Capture. Change Tracking is now the red-headed stepchild, but in many cases may be the best solution for data ETL movement from an SQL Server OLTP database to a data warehouse or reporting database. This session will provide a review of change tracking syntax and implementation with detailed demos. It will then dive into an actual ETL subset implementation from the AdventureWorks database to a data warehouse solution (modified AdventureWorksDW) with detailed code discussion and demos using TSQL only (no SSIS).  A variation of this implementation has run every 5 minutes with never a failure in over 7 years.  Come learn how you can adapt the supplied code to have near real-time in your data warehouse (or reporting database).</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Apache Spark</title>
      <description>As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data. Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes. As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk. Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data. In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark. We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues when analyzing large data sets.</description>

      <title>Using calculation groups in DAX</title>
      <description>Calculation groups are the most important feature introduced in DAX after variables in 2015. By using calculation groups, you can apply transformations to existing measures without having to create new measures in the model. For example, you can define the year-over-year calculation once and apply it to all the measures you want. Yet, calculation groups can do more than that.
This session introduces the syntax of calculation groups, when they should be used and several examples of use cases. You will also learn how calculation groups work internally and what are the limits of this amazing tool.</description>

      <title>DAX Optimization Examples</title>
      <description>How do you optimize a DAX expression? In this session we analyze some DAX expressions and Tabular models and, through the usage of DAX Studio and some understanding of the VertiPaq model, we will look at how to optimize them.
As you will see, most optimizations are the direct application of best practices, but the session has the additional takeaway of understanding what kind of performance you should expect from your formulas, and the improvement you might expect from learning how to optimize the model and the code.</description>
