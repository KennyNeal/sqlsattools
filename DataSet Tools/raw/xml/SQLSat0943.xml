      <description>Hi there! My name is Pam Mooney. The road to IT was a long and winding one for me, but I fell in love with SQL Server and knew that I wanted to be a DBA after my first database class in college.I was fortunate enough to be hired in as a Junior DBA straight out of school, and I have never looked back. I’m now a Senior DBA who loves to mentor and teach – as well as to continue to learn. A one-time, part-time professional musician and songwriter, I have a medical background and am a passionate history nerd. In my spare time, I like to hike, bike, read, go to the Ren Faire, write, and talk to you.</description>

      <description>I have been a Database Administrator/Developer for over 15 years.  In that time I have developed a passion for making systems go fast and solving real problems for real users.  I have also found that I enjoy sharing what I have learned with others and have often volunteered at places I work for tech lunches or small classes; usually to help developers learn or clarify aspects of SQL Server they may not have known about.
I have worked for companies in a variety of industries, from manufacturing, legal, construction, consulting services and finally transportation.  I've enjoyed almost all of them.</description>

He is passionate about sharing knowledge on building a solid T-SQL foundation without wasting time. 

Peter's journey from minimal Excel knowledge to writing Dynamic SQL all started from watching Youtube videos for three hours every morning before work.

      <title>Learn How to Master DATETIME Functions Like a Boss in 59.5 Minutes or Less</title>
      <description>- Do you know the dates of the 1st Monday, 2nd Tuesday, 3rd Wednesday, and 4th Thursday of any month between the 22 weeks and 47 weeks of any given year? 

- Do you know the date that Daylight Savings starts in Nashville 4 years from now?

Those two questions may have been a trivial but there is nothing trivial about working within the complexity of dates and times. Trains, Planes, and sometimes at automobile races depend on precise and accurate date-time recordings. 

In this demo-heavy presentation, we will answer the following questions and more:
- When to use DATETIME and DATETIME2 and why.
- How do you filter date ranges that will make SQL Server run faster?
- How language and date formatting affect EVERYTHING.
- What's the best way to work with functions relating to the current date and time.
- What's the best way to properly use SWITCHOFFSET, TODATETIMEOFFSET and AT TIME ZONE Functions. 

So stop wasting time and get on board because it's about time for the plane to depart.</description>

      <title>Get Your Optimizer to Give up All Its Secrets</title>
      <description>You know that execution plans can provide you with vital information to tune a query, but just how does that plan get generated?  In this session, we will examine details of the query optimization process that are not very well known.  We will discuss how SQL Server parses a T-SQL statement then  begins applying rules to make it more efficient.  Did you know that SQL Server can be coaxed into outputting hidden structures such as parse trees and memos?  We'll do just that, and then take it a step further with a free unique visualization tool that I have created.  With a better understanding of how SQL Server optimizes T-SQL (and sometimes doesn't do it as well as might be hoped), you can write more efficient SQL statements.</description>

      <title>Real-World PowerShell for SQL Administration</title>
      <description>If you're like me, you've attended PowerShell sessions before. However, much of the *practical* usage of PS comes with rolling back your sleeves and digging into the nuances of syntax and how to get things done. We are going to focus specifically on using PowerShell within the SQL Server Agent to build out everyday jobs.

In this session, I'm assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell. What we're going to cover are some of the "gotchas" and nuances that I've run into when I've been working with the language, and particularly with the SQL Agent's flavor of PowerShell.

And then we'll spend the balance of our time looking at real-world, practical scripts that I use pretty much every day. PowerShell is an awesome way to automate so many processes and relieve some of the everyday monotony of SQL administration.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Factory: Ingestion Framework</title>
      <description>You're going to learn how to design an Ingestion Framework capable of scaling multiple sources without additional pipelines to populate Azure Data Lake. We will walk through Ingestion Strategy, the Ingestion Model, and the Ingestion Pipelines that fully automate data lake ingestion.

Ingestion Strategy - First, we will lay the foundation for best practices when it comes to ingesting data and storing data within Azure Data Lake. 

Ingestion Model - Second, we will learn how to design a metadata model framework built using Data Vault techniques to capture and store data from across the business.

Ingestion Pipelines - Finally, we will build two Data Factory pipelines that read from the framework and does that actual data ingestion, these are built so that we only ever have to build these two pipelines when scaling to a new source type.</description>

      <title>Code Smells - How to Keep Your Code From Stinking!</title>
      <description>Maybe you’ve had some experience writing SQL, but no one’s ever told you what not to do. Or maybe you’re aware of some bad habits to avoid when writing SQL, but no one has ever shown you why a bad practice can hurt your query – or SQL Server.  Perhaps you feel a little more confident with your TSQL, but don’t understand why your queries aren’t running as quickly as you would like.

Bad SQL coding practices are known in the SQL community as “code smells”.  Sign up for this hour-long workshop where you will work with me through five common coding mistakes that can make performance stink. By the time we’re done, you’ll have a better idea of how to freshen up some problem queries.</description>

      <title>Why Learn Python?  A Microsoft DB/ETL/BI Developer's Answer</title>
      <description>You're a Microsoft Developer.  C#, MSSQL, SSIS/SSRS, SSMS, and Azure are your tools of choice.  Why would you want to learn Python?  In this session, I will show you several take-home utilities that use Python.  The first hunts through a folder structure full of SSIS packages looking for the one(s) that load(s) a specified table.  The second executes the data sources in an SSRS report to identify performance problems and document them in Excel.  The third GeoCodes the City/Country names from a SQL table, getting the Lat/Lng so you can use the data in maps.  Familiarity with Python is not necessary to use the utilities, but we're not going to do Hello World either.  This is real Python for Microsoft Database, ETL and BI Developers.  This all-demo session shows you how to use Python with the .Net CLR,  XML, ODBC, Excel, SQL Server, and Web API calls.</description>

      <title>SQL DevOps Simplified with Production Databases</title>
      <description>DevOps is based on building an application binary (immutable artifact) that supports a highly reliable, repeatable engineering process.  In the case of SQL Server, however, a database is already in production, and isn’t simply replaced (as an app binary), but is upgraded.   Current SQL Server DevOps methods use source control to build a “development” database, with schema and objects and static data needed for functional testing.  "Near production data" is used in Staging, and finally production is upgraded.  This approach involves complexity, and breaks the principle of working with immutable artifacts throughout the process.  Our session introduces a new approach to SQL Server DevOps, with production databases used in all stages.   Production database clones are delivered more quickly than "built" databases, are more easily integrated with source control, and produces higher fidelity outcomes.  Learn how leading enterprises are simplifying SQL DevOps.</description>

      <title>Modern SQL Server CPU Architecture</title>
      <description>Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.</description>

      <title>Python in SQL Server 2017 and 2019</title>
      <description>SQL Server 2017 and 2019 have arrived, bringing with them a host of exciting new features.  Of particular interest to BI practitioners and data scientists is the integration of the Python programming language into the SQL ecosystem.  This integration opens up a number of possibilities for in-database analytics and intelligent database applications, so let's get started!

In this introductory session we'll briefly introduce the Python language and then look at how to install and administer Machine Learning Services.  We'll start to demonstrate the power of Python by showing you how to create and run simple scripts from within T-SQL.  We'll then discuss some of the powerful open source packages that are available to aid your data analyses.  Finally, we'll go through some examples of how to use Python to integrate data analytical methods in real-world situations, and wow your customers with the power of analytics!</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Extended Events</title>
      <description>Few subjects in Microsoft SQL Server inspire the same amount of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) as Extended Events. Many DBAs continue to use Profiler and SQL Trace even though they have been deprecated for years. Why is this?

Extended Events started out in SQL Server 2008 with no user interface and only a few voices in the community documenting the features as they found them. Since then, it has blossomed into a full feature of SQL Server and an amazingly low-impact replacement for Profiler and Trace.

Come learn how to get started - the basics of sessions, events, actions, targets, packages, and more.  We will look at some base scenarios where Extended Events can be very useful as well as considering a few gotchas along the way. You may never go back to Profiler again!</description>

      <title>PowerShell for the DBA</title>
      <description>PowerShell is a tool used by many people in DevOps and Infrastructure. Should the DBA get on board with using PowerShell? The answer is yes - as a DBA, PowerShell can have a significant impact on tasks that would be long and tedious with just T-SQL alone. Today there are specific modules that can be incorporated into PowerShell to help in automating every-day DBA tasks. Beyond that, PowerShell can be used to do things like automate deployments and audit permissions. 

In this session we will explore real-world examples and demonstrate how PowerShell can be leveraged by the DBA to not only improve efficiency but also streamline processes across an enterprise environment.</description>

      <title>Principle of Least Privilege: The Key to Strong Security</title>
      <description>A truly strong security model starts with no permissions and adds what is necessary to allow the user or application to do their assigned task - no more, no less. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. It's a simple concept, but it can be quite difficult to implement in practice, especially if the prevailing practice has been much more permissive.

In this session, we'll talk about the Principle of Least Privilege in more detail, and we'll discuss ways to implement it for the three primary classes of users - general users, applications, and administrators. Each has their own set of needs that requires a separate approach to allowing the security to meet those needs. You'll leave with actionable ideas on ways that you can improve your company's security while minimizing the impact of the changes.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Power BI</title>
      <description>This sessions will provide an introduction to Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service. 
With Power BI Desktop, we will import data from several sources, then perform some cleanup and transformation of the data. We will build a model from the data and then some visualizations of it. Then we will publish the model to the Power BI Service and build a dashboard from it, then look at how it can be used in collaboration scenarios and distribution in your organization.</description>

      <title>Moving Data to the Cloud (with Azure Data Factory)</title>
      <description>You need to move data.  A lot of data.  To the cloud.  You’ve got data in a variety of on- and off-site data sources.  There are several ways to do it.  Some of them can be quite easily implemented using Azure Data Factory.  Learn how to use variables and looping in your Data Factory pipelines.  Use the Integration Runtime to pull directly from on-site sources.  See how to upload files to blob storage and import them.  Learn how to trigger Data Factory activities.  And, learn how to keep all those connection strings and passwords secret in Azure Vault.  After this session, you will have tools that you can readily implement in your own data migrations.</description>

      <title>Capturing SQL Server activity with SQL Server Audit</title>
      <description>In today’s environment, more and more companies are finding that they need to capture the activity on their SQL Server instances. SQL Server Audit is a tool built into SQL Server that is designed to fill that need. With this tool, a DBA can capture nearly any action taken on a SQL Server, even some that cannot be captured by any other method.

In this session, we’ll take a detailed look at the capabilities of SQL Server Audit, how to configure it, and how to use the data it produces. We’ll also look into the areas where SQL Server Audit falls short and how to supplement it with other SQL Server tools to provide a complete auditing solution.

This session is part of the Data Security Learning Pathway. For more information please visit our Learning Pathways page.</description>

      <title>Azure Data Explorer: Bringing Visibility to the Data Lake</title>
      <description>Is your data lake a bit more like a swamp? Are your business analysts nearly drowning when you throw them into the deep end of the lake? 
In this session, you'll see how to use Azure Data Explorer to create a more structured interface on the files in your data lake, so that your business analysts can consume it much more easily from tools like Power BI. 
Azure Data Explorer (ADX) is a service that adds a query engine to various types of data, including raw files in a data lake. We'll look at the two ways you can add some structure and visibility to your data lake files using ADX, to eliminate the need for your data consumers to know the location and type of files in the data lake, and to add context such as entity names and data types. With a very small amount of simple code, you can add this structure to your data lake files and let the business analysts focus on the data. 
This session uses Azure Data Explorer and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS gen2) as well as a bit of Power BI.</description>

      <title>Using tSQLt unit testing with SSDT Database Projects</title>
      <description>Unit testing is a key part of a DevOps process that helps to improve code quality (and increase your confidence). 

Using tSQLt, a unit testing framework for SQL Server databases, you can create "mock" tables that contain test data and have powerful comparison assertions to validate your merge logic for more complex data change scenarios - beyond simple Type I and Type II Slowly Changing Dimensions. 

This session will show how to write basic unit tests for a data warehouse/mart project, with a focus on unit tests for stored procedures that merge staging tables to dimensional and fact tables. 

In this session we'll also see how to structure your database projects in Visual Studio (SQL Server Data Tools) to separate your test code from your database structures and the unit test framework (in this case, tSQLt).</description>

      <description>You may have heard the term “DevOps” a lot lately, but is this just one of those buzzwords that gets thrown around and means something different depending on who’s talking? While traditional software methodologies pit developers and operations folks like DBAs against each other, DevOps requires that they work together for a common goal. And, ultimately, shouldn’t the software project’s success be everyone’s goal? Attend this session to learn how DevOps is changing the DBAs world for the better and how Redgate’s tools can make your journey to DevOps easier.</description>

      <title>Introduction to T-SQL Windowing Functions</title>
      <description>T-SQL windowing functions can simplify many complex queries. They are the best thing that has happened to the T-SQL language in years, but many database professionals and developers haven’t heard about them. 
They were initially introduced with SQL Server 2005. In 2012, Microsoft added several new functions that let you do things like pull values from different rows without a performance penalty. 
Attend this session to learn how T-SQL windowing functions apply to many real world examples.</description>

      <title>Navigating Row Level Security</title>
      <description>New to SQL Server 2016 (okay, it's a few years old already, but it still feels new) is Row Level Security, which allows database developers and architects to effectively lock down tables, giving users access to a defined subset of data in the table.  It sounds easy enough, but there are a number of design considerations and pitfalls to be aware of.  This session will work through a few demos to implement RLS and dive into those pitfalls that need to be avoided.  For anyone considering implementing Row Level Security or have tried but have run into issues, this should be a session you want to attend.</description>
