      <title>How to Budget for a Azure Migration</title>
      <description>You have heard all about the awesome opportunities that utilizing cloud technology provides and you are sold! Technically, everyone agrees it's the right answer and are ready to get started. However, there is one problem. Your organization needs to understand what its going to cost before approving the project. Understanding the cost to move to Azure and its run rate are questions several companies struggle with and can present a major roadblock for moving forward. Oftentimes it's not because the cost is too high, its simply because they do not know what to expect and budget for. In this session, we will walk through the process of building estimates, creating a Azure budget and discuss the several unique considerations you need to be mindful of such as networking, storage, service dependencies, workload considerations and more. As you explore opportunities to migrate to the cloud, don't let cost be a deterring factor.</description>

      <title>I lost my job!  Now what?!?  A survival guide for the unemployed</title>
      <description>You've just been told by HR that you are no longer a part of their organization.  You've been kicked to the curb.  You are now living in the no-man's land called unemployment.

Unemployment is a scary situation.  You're dealing with emotions and uncertainty.  You don't know if you'll be out of work for days, weeks, or months.

Fortunately, unemployment is survivable.  In this session, I'll share my own experiences (and perhaps we'll talk about some of yours) with unemployment, and how I managed to get through the tough times.  We'll discuss emotional impact, the job hunt, and things you can do to get yourself through this tough time.  Hopefully, you'll land on your feet once again before long!</description>

      <title>Turn Runbooks into Notebooks: Handling Maintenance and Emergencies with Azure Data Studio</title>
      <description>On-call DBAs have all had that phone call in the middle of the night: "the database is down, fix it now!" We start scrambling to piece together various scripts to analyze the emergency, mitigate the issues, and kick off a failover or similar fix to make the database happy and healthy once again. Even scheduled maintenance likely requires us to download scripts from a ticket, run the scripts, and screenshot the results for documentation. What if I told you that Azure Data Studio's notebooks allow you to execute T-SQL and PowerShell together to handle these processes from a single document that documents its own results and can be stored directly in source control? Join me in this demo-heavy session to see how we can handle real-world on-call situations using Azure Data Studio notebooks.</description>

      <title>Modern SQL Server CPU Architectures for Performance</title>
      <description>Modern CPU architectures are complex and misunderstood, especially as they relate to SQL Server instance configuration and database usage patterns. Default values in virtualization and the SQL Server instance can cause misalignments and improper balance in the way the SQL Server lines up with the CPUs and memory, which results in an immediate (and silent) performance penalty. Come learn as we discuss topics such as physical and virtual NUMA, hyperthreading, query parallelism, public cloud CPU selection, and SQL Server instance settings, and show you how to validate your SQL Server architecture and improve the performance of your critical SQL Servers for both on-prem and cloud-based SQL Servers.</description>

      <title>Advanced Plan Explorer Usage for Tuning Execution Plans</title>
      <description>In 2010, SentryOne gave the community a completely free execution plan analysis tool: Plan Explorer, that is widely used today. But many users only utilize basic features and only scratch the surface of its capabilities.

Join me to learn how you can go beyond the basics. This demo-heavy (and marketing free) session will teach you advanced use of Plan Explorer by exploring practical T-SQL anti-patterns.</description>

      <title>Certification Exams Inside Out</title>
      <description>Preparing for Microsoft certification? Do you want insight into how certification exams are written, how questions are designed, and how to follow a logical process of elimination? We'll go through the process of item creation from an item writer's viewpoint, what rules item writers must follow, and why questions sometimes have strange phrasing. For any technical skillset pursuing certification, we'll review non-technical sample questions and walk through the process of using information at your disposal. You'll better understand how to deconstruct the problem statement. We'll leave time for QA with a veteran of the Microsoft certification exam writing process.</description>

      <title>SELECT Questions FROM Diversity.Inclusion WHERE AfraidToAsk = 1</title>
      <description>In the past several years Diversity, Equity,  Inclusion (DEI) have become more important and visible in the workplace.  Studies have shown that organizations are often more successful when they are more diverse, yet the tech sector is moving slowly to improve representation and inclusion.  Many IT professionals want to improve but don't know where to start.  

This session will cover key concepts in DEI and how they apply to data practitioners.</description>

      <title>From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019</title>
      <description>As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the "adaptive query processing" features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as "intelligent query processing". This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help - or hurt! - you.</description>

      <title>Checking in on Tabular Models: Making Them Work Better</title>
      <description>We've all seen, and probably created, a few tabular models that are just dog-slow. For the people just starting with tabular models to those who've been around the block a few times with them, we'll go over some ways in which I've sped up tabular models to be leaner and faster. So join me and learn (or remember) several different things to do with tabular models to make them just plain better.</description>
