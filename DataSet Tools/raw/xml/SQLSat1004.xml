      <title>Azure SQL Database-Business Continuity During Disaster</title>
      <description>Azure SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on the latest version of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine. You can build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure. 

While considering Azure SQL Database, two of the most critical questions you need to answer are what are my options for business continuity and how to implement these options? 

In this demo intensive session, I will talk about five specific options and show you how to implement those. You will walk out of this session equipped with knowledge and scripts to implement appropriate High Availability and Disaster Recovery solutions for your Azure SQL Database.</description>

      <title>Multi-server agent jobs administration with happy faces and pigeons</title>
      <description>This talk will be about multi-server administration using MSX and TSX servers. Built-in feature you may have seen, but was too scared to play with. Will show you how to configure multi-server environment and how to manage it with least possible resources.

What SQL Server and pigeons have in common? Not much, besides that you do not want to be a pigeon – pigeon post to be specific.
I have been a DBA pigeon in my past. Managing hundreds of SQL Servers and visiting every single SQL Agent to setup the maintenance jobs, backup jobs or any jobs that would help me to keep the servers up and running. Sometimes using SQL scripts, other times Powershell scripts to deploy or update new jobs, but it was still the same ol’ way. Flying between instances like a bird. Until, one day, I found out about MSX and TSX! And now my life is full of happy faces! I want your face to be happy too.

In this session you will learn how easy is to setup this hidden and forgotten feature of SQL Server. Will show you</description>

      <title>How to audit and prevent unwanted user actions.</title>
      <description>Abstract:

Many corporations are composed of small divisions located in countries throughout the world. While you might be the lead DBA for your corporation, there are several other employees who have the keys to the kingdom. This presentation will review techniques on how to prevent and/or audit data and schema changes.

Coverage:

1 – Granting correct user access is vital.
2 – DML triggers to keep a DATA audit trail.
3 – DDL triggers to keep a SCHEMA audit trail.
4 – Preventing unwanted DATA modifications.
5 – Preventing unwanted SCHEMA changes.
6 – Preventing table TRUNCATIONS.
7 – LOGIN triggers to control who, what, and when.
8 – Change data capture (CDC) an alternative to triggers.
9 - Which of these techniques apply to an Azure SQL database?</description>

      <title>Life Cycle of a Query in SQL Server</title>
      <description>Many DBA's and Developers work with SQL Server but don’t fully understand how it really works behind the scenes. Join Deepthi on her dive into the internals of SQL Server to explain why knowing what goes on under the covers will help you make better decisions quickly when solving performance problems in SQL Server. This session will cover ACID properties, key components of the Relational Engine, Storage engine, Cache and the Transaction manager. We will also cover what happens  under the covers during read and write operations within SQL Server. 
Deepthi will show you how the SQL engine thinks – enabling you to think like it!</description>
