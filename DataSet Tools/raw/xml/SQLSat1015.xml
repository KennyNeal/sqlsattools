      <title>From XL to S - Reduce your Power BI model size by 90%!</title>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what makes Power BI so fast and powerful when it comes to performance? So powerful, that it performs complex calculations over millions of rows in a blink of an eye.

In this session, we will dig deep to discover what is “under the hood” of Power BI, how your data is being stored, compressed, queried, and finally, brought back to your report. After the session, you will get a better understanding of the hard work happening in the background and appreciate the importance of creating an optimal data model in order to get maximum performance from the Power BI engine.

Finally, you will see a real use-case demo showing how the Power BI data model was reduced by 90%!</description>

      <title>Designing impactful visualisations for your data</title>
      <description>As Data is key, visualising said data is even more important. We want our message to be understood with ease, and merely with a couple of glances. Hence making sure the receiving party can do so with ease will be vital to our success.

During this session, we'll go through some steps on how to maximise the potential of data visualisations. Starting at choosing the right types of visualisations, and which colour palettes are good matches for your message, we'll also make sure that our designs are as inclusive as we can possibly make them. Wrapping up with a few common use cases, you’ll definitely pick up a few new things to take home with you.

Walking out of this session, you can expect to have a decent understanding on a few common design principles for your data visualisations and reports.</description>

      <description>Many DBA's and Developers work with SQL Server but don’t fully understand how it really works behind the scenes. Join Deepthi on her dive into the internals of SQL Server to explain why knowing what goes on under the covers will help you make better decisions quickly when solving performance problems in SQL Server. This session will cover ACID properties, key components of the Relational Engine, Storage engine, Cache and the Transaction manager. This session will also cover how SQL optimizer chooses the plans, how cache in sql Server is managed, what happens under the covers during read and write operations within SQL Server. This session will also have demo of how queries are processed at each component inside SQL Engine. 
Deepthi will show you how the SQL engine thinks – enabling you to think like it!</description>

      <title>ABCs of the Power BI REST API</title>
      <description>In this session we will be looking into managing our Power BI content using only the Power BI REST API. While the Power BI REST API is extensive, we will be limiting this session on the following sections of interest: Dashboards, Datasets, Reports  Groups.

How many Dashboards are there in a workspace?
Which Datasource is this Dataset configured to use?
Who is allowed to see this Report?
Can I take ownership of this Dataset?
How do I resfresh my Dataset?
Is my Dataset refreshing on a schedule?
...
Those are just some of the questions we will find the answers to.

Examples will be provided in Powershell, which may require minute skills up front. Not to worry, a quick intro will be provided as well.

Attending this session will make you familiar with the Power BI REST API and provide you with guidance on how to manage the most common tasks in Power BI.</description>

      <title>Financial Modelling with Power BI</title>
      <description>Bob has been involved in taking Financial Models from paper based to highly dynamic analytics models in Microsoft BI for many large enterprises in Ireland.

Building Successful Financial Models based of a Chart of Accounts and General Ledger can be difficult for a number of reasons:
-	Dynamic/Growing Chart of Accounts
-	Many to Many Structure
-	Parent Child
-	Ragged Hierarchies on financial reports
-	Unary Operators such as running sums 
-	Entity Attribute Value structures
-	Overhead Allocation
-	Modelling Profit Variations like EDBITA

      <title>Analyze and solve common wait stats scenarios</title>
      <description>SQL Server is a high frequently used piece of software which need to serve single requests and/or hundreds of thousands of requests in a minute. Within these different kinds of workloads Microsoft SQL Server has to handle the concurrency of tasks in a fashion manner. This demo driven session shows different scenarios where Microsoft SQL Server has to wait and manage hundreds of tasks. See, analyze and solve different wait stats due to their performance impact:
- CXPACKET: when a query goes parallel
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION: speed up IO operations (Growth / Backup / Restore)
- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO: What happens if your application refuses data?
- THREADPOOL starvation: crush of requests for Microsoft SQL Server
- PAGELATCH_xx: How does Microsoft SQL Server protects data?</description>

      <title>Crushing a Cloud Migration: Moving Mountains While Migrating Data</title>
      <description>Are you an architect or DBA who has been tasked with executing a cloud migration? Are you a consultant who is trying to wrestle with the scale and scope of a cloud migration for a client? While there are certainly technical issues to solve and tooling selections to understand and execute, what often gets lost in a migration are the political and organizational mountains that need to be moved for the project to be successful. Technical success will not happen with our organizational success - they work hand in hand to lead to a successful conclusion.

As we walk through this session we will discuss and demo the technologies and tools that are useful for a cloud migration - and we\'ll review some that are not useful and talk about why they should be avoided. We will also mix in discussions of successful migrations and how the team worked together to move those organizational and political mountains out of the way in order to execute a successful cloud migration to make clients, customers</description>

      <description>Are you a database developer, a DBA or a data analyst? Do you find spending quite a bit of time trying to reproduce analysis or reproduce issues and the troubleshooting techniques? This Notebooks 101 session is for you!

The lack of rigor in being able to reproduce analysis in business context or to reproduce data troubleshooting can lead to confusion and time wasted on work that had been previously done. With Notebooks, Data Professionals can share their techniques and data sources used for the data analysis or troubleshooting for code review and reproducible insights/troubleshooting. 

Azure Data Studio Notebooks support SQL and KQL natively with intellisense; with easy to use charting capabilities. With Notebooks and Jupyter Book (collection of Notebooks) in Azure Data Studio, it’s also easy now for your team to build an onboarding guide (user manual) / documentation on data sources, useful sample scripts and tutorials.</description>

      <title>The ins and outs of securing SQL Server traffic</title>
      <description>We are frequently hearing of an enterprise-size business being hacked, data being stolen, or data being exploited. Data security has always been important, but it should not be taken for granted. Data is information, and one of the greatest assets to a business, and when it is compromised, things go south quickly.

While there are multiple levels of security (securing data at rest, data in traffic, etc.), this session will focus on securing data that is on the move; ie., securing traffic between a client and server. We'll discuss and look at two solutions: Certificates and IPsec, exploring them in detail, outlining the pros and cons of each, how to set up and configure them, and when to use what.</description>

      <title>Power BI Dataflows on Steroids: Handling 100+ million records using Enhanced Compute Engine</title>
      <description>Power BI dataflows used for self-service data preparation within the Power BI ecosystem. When a large volume of data and complex transformations should be handled, Enhanced Compute Engine should be enabled to support DirectQuery queries against Power BI dataflows and accelerate the transformations in upstream dataflows. In this session, we will present how to use Enhanced Compute Engine for managing 100+ million records in multi-phase ETL processes containing complex transformations, then implementing Power BI composite models and aggregations over this large amount of data stored in Power BI dataflows. We will also present in detail the best practices for Power BI dataflows to manage such a huge volume of data. We will focus also on how to store dataflows in your organization’s ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2 account instead of using the built-in one.</description>

      <title>Not My Problem(?) - Azure Networking 101 for Azure SQL Server DBAs</title>
      <description>The unofficial scapegoats of the the IT world has always been "the network" or "the database". The traditional way of doing things on-prem has unfortunately added to this divide - either you're a networking specialist or a DBA, and very rarely will the same person do both jobs. 
As an on-prem DBA, chances are that you never had to think twice about which network the database was in, what kind of endpoint was used for the traffic or how the firewall was configured. In Azure, things can get rather complex pretty quickly - especially when working with the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) version of Azure SQL Server. 
This session will walk you through the basics of networking, explore the concept of virtual networks and firewalls, and explain the use of endpoints - all from the perspective of how they relate to Azure SQL Server. We will be looking at both how the technical components work, and also why one would choose a specific design in favor of another.</description>

      <title>Finding Islands, Gaps, and Clusters in Complex Data</title>
      <description>Gaps and islands problems are often treated as academic problems that are discussed without relevant real-life problems to solve.

By subdividing a data set into meaningful groups of islands, we can perform analytics against it that would otherwise be slow, error-prone, or seemingly impossible!

Data clustering can be applied to complex data sets in order to answer questions about winning streaks, financial performance, monitoring/alerting, goal achievement, and more!

Data quality becomes critical when crunching data in this fashion.  We address duplicate data, bad data, NULL, and any other unexpected weirdness that a user might throw at us.

This is a fast-paced session that delves into methods that can be applied to any data.  A complete set of historical baseball records will be used as our imperfect sample data in order to everything from a player's hitting streak to the longest winning streak by a team on Wednesdays at night.</description>

      <title>Strukturierung des Data Lake</title>
      <description>Der Data Lake, unendliche Weiten, unendlicher Speicherplatz, unendliche Möglichkeiten, Daten zu sammeln und zu horten. Aber ist das das Ziel? Gerade in einem Data Lake gibt es Regeln, wie man Daten speichert, Entwickler müssen sich mit Namenskonventionen, Busniess Regeln und Richtlinien auseinandersetzen.

In dieser Session zeigen wir, welche unterschiedlichen Konzepte es für die Strukturierung eines Data Lakes gibt und wie Sie die verschiedenen theoretischen Ansätze in die Praxis überführen. 

Welche Namenskonventionen haben sich etabliert oder sollten vermieden werden. Der Azure Data Lake bietet darüber hianus auch eine gewisse Unterstützung auf der Infrastrukturseite in Form von Richtlinien, die beim Aufbau eines sauberen Data Lakes helfen können.

I got inspired for this session by questions from https://community.powerbi.com. These questions are touching the most foundational concepts. They remind me of my journey into the realm of evaluation context, filter propagation, data lineage, the scope of variables, and the mysterious world of table iterators, just to name some concepts.
I explain these concepts using small datasets that allowing us to perform computation without leveraging the cloud, but please be prepared for some surprises. The presentation uses a single pbix file that will be available for download after the session.</description>

      <title>Intro to Query Store</title>
      <description>In this session, we will look at the new Query Store feature in SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019.  Query Store tracks changes in execution plans, allowing you to easily view performance differences and revert to older plans with a few clicks of the mouse in 2016.

Then in 2017, Microsoft added wait stats per query plan and Automatic Plan Correction capabilities.  Allowing DBAs more tools to troubleshoot fires with and a way to automatically resolve issues.

In this session, we will walk through the features of the Query Store, so you can understand how to use them in SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019.</description>

      <description>You can make advanced business analytics also with T-SQL, you do not need to use R, Python, or some other currently fashionable language for every single in-depth view in your data. In addition, you can get magnitudes better performance inside a database management system when in statistical languages and engines. You will learn how to use T-SQL for queries that you might already be familiar with, for aggregating queries. But this is only to warm you up. Then you will learn how to do hazard and survival analysis, market basket analysis with association rules using different measures like support and confidence, and even sequential market basket analysis, when there is a sequence in the basket. Then the session introduces the look-alike model, which is a mixture of k-nearest neighbor and decision trees algorithms. The session finishes with Bayesian inference implemented with T-SQL.</description>

      <title>DIY ETL with Logic apps, Azure Functions and more</title>
      <description>How do we handle the edge cases, the unique or temporary solutions to get data from emails, file shares, FTP, someone's desktop etc? 
We need DIY ETL when the easy data sources don't exist, and the usual methods won't work.
In this session, we'll take 3 scenarios, solve them and make them reliable, and repeatable, with tools like Power Automate, logic apps, Azure functions and more.</description>

      <title>BI in Azure two years live</title>
      <description>After more than two years live with BI in Azure Alexander Klein would like to give an honest feedback. 

Which architecture is the right one? Which tools/services should I use ( Azure Data Factory V1 or V2, Azure Stream Analytics, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL DW, Azure Analysis Service, Azure Data Lake, Power BI, Azure Databricks ...) ?
What was good and what wasn't so good? What do you have to pay attention to? What can you possibly do better in the next project?

Alexander Klein will answer all these questions and more in this presentation.</description>

      <title>From adaptive to intelligent: query processing in SQL 2019</title>
      <description>As announced in September 2018, SQL Server 2019 expands the “adaptive query processing” features of SQL 2017 and relabels them as “intelligent query processing”. This name now covers many features, such as batch mode on rowstore, memory grant feedback, interleaved execution, adaptive joins, deferred compilation, and approximate query processing.

In this high-paced session, we will look at all these features and cover some use cases where they might help – or hurt! – you.</description>

      <title>External Tools for Power BI, how to create them!</title>
      <description>Power BI offers an add-in to work with 3rd party external tools like Tabular Editor, DAX Studio and ALM toolkit. The fact that you can use a tool of your own preference is already really cool! But did you know that you can build these tools yourself pretty easy? 

In this session I will show you how I build my model documentation external tool and how you can start doing this yourself!</description>
