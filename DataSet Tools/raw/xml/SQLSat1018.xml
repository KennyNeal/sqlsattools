      <title>Designing impactful visualisations for your data</title>
      <description>As Data is key, visualising said data is even more important. We want our message to be understood with ease, and merely with a couple of glances. Hence making sure the receiving party can do so with ease will be vital to our success.

During this session, we'll go through some steps on how to maximise the potential of data visualisations. Starting at choosing the right types of visualisations, and which colour palettes are good matches for your message, we'll also make sure that our designs are as inclusive as we can possibly make them. Wrapping up with a few common use cases, you’ll definitely pick up a few new things to take home with you.

Walking out of this session, you can expect to have a decent understanding on a few common design principles for your data visualisations and reports.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Apache Spark</title>
      <description>As companies work to gain insight from ever-increasing amounts of data, data platform practitioners need tools which can scale along with the data. Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes. As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk. Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data. In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark. We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues when analyzing large data sets.</description>

      <title>Continuous Integration for the BI Developer</title>
      <description>In many cases and BI projects, the manual process of development and especially deployment of artefacts led to sleepless nights, emergency hotfixes, grey hair and many hours of stress.
Especially in BI development, the usage of database projects, unit testing, version control, continuous integration and deployment is an underrepresented area.
Join me in this demo-heavy session where I will guide you through the not-so-frightful jungle of continuous integration using SQL Server database projects, SSIS, T-SQLt and Azure DevOps etc.
After this 60 minutes you'll have the guidelines and some ideas how easy it is to change your manual BI development and deployment into a powerful and automated no-brainer that - just works!</description>

      <title>Intro to CDS inside of Power Automate (fka Microsoft Flow)</title>
      <description>The Microsoft Common Data Service lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Data within Common Data Service is stored within a set of entities. An entity is a set of records used to store data, similar to how a table stores data within a database.

Learn how the CDS ties into Power Automate (Flow), what Triggers and actions are available and how you can use this all.</description>

      <title>Deep Dive on Embedded Analytics with Power BI</title>
      <description>Microsoft Power BI Embedded is a Microsoft Azure that enables developers to integrate Power BI reports into their web or mobile applications so they do not need to build custom solutions to visualize data for the users. 
Microsoft Power BI Embedded helps Independent Software Vendors to use Power BI data experiences within their applications. Customers, who use applications with Power BI Embedded, do not need to have a Power BI account or to know anything about this Azure service. 
This session covers the major concepts, related to Power BI Embedded Analytics: 
-	Use-cases
-	Architecture
-	Licensing
-	Application development
-	Application deployment</description>

      <title>Basic Data Modeling for BI Reporting</title>
      <description>We all start using business intelligence tools by using a single dataset, like a flat file.  Then, we hit a plateau in our learning curve, or we add a second flat file into our BI product, and we get incorrect results.  One reason is that we haven't modeled our solution correctly.

In order to move to the next level of our journey along the BI learning curve, we need to understand how a tool like Power BI works.  Only then will we understand why we design our data models the way we do.

In this session, we will review how tools like Power BI work under the covers and how that impacts the way we construct our data models.  This is an introductory level course, so we will not get too technical, just enough to get us to the next level and moving back up that learning curve!</description>

The session will provide an introduction to Analysis Services and why it should be used. The rest of the time will be spent in live demonstrations building an analytical database.  The session will start with a blank project and show the steps for data sources and data sets. The data modeling will include relationships and hierarchies. The DAX language will be used to create measures including a Key Performance Indicator. The more advanced examples will include a many to many relationship as well as a slowly changing dimension table. The reporting will be throughout the session using Excel PivotTables/Chart as well as Power BI.</description>

      <title>Improving Analytics Performance With Columnstore Indexes</title>
      <description>Administrators and analysts often struggle with the storage and maintenance of reporting and analytics data.  Traditional rowstore tables do not scale well when data is measured in billions of rows.

Columnstore indexes provide a speedy and convenient way to store OLAP data within SQL Server.  Compression allows the data to be much smaller than other storage methods, allowing for faster reads.  Column metadata provides the tools needed for SQL Server to be able to service queries over massive data sets quickly and efficiently.

The basics of columnstore indexes allow an administrator to improve the performance of analytics, but there is much more to learn!  Understanding the internals of columnstore indexes allows querying to be even more efficient.

Columnstore indexes have evolved greatly since their introduction in SQL Server 2012.  This presentation explores this feature in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2019 and how its newest features can turbo-charge your analytics workloads!</description>

      <title>Exploring the Power BI Desktop Designer</title>
      <description>Learn why Microsoft Power BI is taking market share in the enterprise reporting tools area.

The desktop designer is an easy to use application that can mash up data from various sources and create visual reports that will dazzle your users.

Under the hood, the M-Language mashes up data from various sources into a relational data model; the x-velocity engine stores the data in an efficient column store format; and the DAX language can extend the model when necessary.

In short, the Power BI Desktop designer is a one stop place to turn mundane data into dynamic reports.</description>

      <title>Different Types of Many-to-Many Relationships in Power BI</title>
      <description>The new composite models in Power BI introduced a new type of relationship cardinality, called many-to-many. Nevertheless, despite their name, they are not many-to-many relationships, they are relationships between tables generated at a different granularity.

In this session, we clarify the purpose of the relationships with many-to-many cardinality, highlighting the significant difference with canonical many-to-many relationships. In the meantime, we show how and when to use the different kinds of many-to-many relationships with several practical examples.</description>

      <title>An (Advanced) Introduction to DAX</title>
      <description>Coming from the Excel world, DAX can look like Excel formulas on steroids. However, to be successful with DAX and Powerpivot, you'll need a completely different mental model. In this introduction to DAX, we won't spend too much time on the basics. Instead, we'll focus the concepts that make DAX unique. This will help you avoid the stumbling blocks of working with DAX. We will cover calculated columns, measures, aggregations, filtering, and iterators.</description>
